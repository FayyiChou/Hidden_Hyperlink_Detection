	<h2>Do you need scooter insurance?</h2>
<br />
<p>When it comes to a cheap and practical means of getting around, a scooter or moped is hard to beat. Easy to handle and fun to ride, the added appeal of scooters is that theyre also cheaper to buy, have lower maintenance costs, are kinder to the environment than cars, and they cost less to tax and insure than virtually any other type of motorised vehicle. Most 50cc scooters or mopeds can also be legally ridden on UK roads (excluding motorways) from the age of 16, provided L plates are displayed at all times until the rider has completed a practical and theory test when they turn 17.</p>

<p>You can also ride a 125cc scooter without passing your test as long as you have a provisional licence, or Compulsory Basic Training (CBT). But whether youre still a learner or buying a scooter for the first time, you are legally required to both tax and insure the vehicle before you can ride it. There are no exceptions, so if youre planning to buy a scooter or moped, you need to arrange insurance before you can take it out on the road. Being caught riding without valid insurance can have serious consequences and as well having to pay a fine you could have your scooter confiscated. You could even end up with a criminal record.</p>

<br />

<h2>What kind of insurance do you need?</h2>
<br />
<p>There are basically three types of scooter insurance to choose from and the price will vary depending on which level of cover you go for although its important to remember that the cheapest option isnt always the best one, especially if it doesnt provide you with all the insurance cover you need. So what are the three types of scooter insurance?</p>

<ul  style="list-style-type:none;">
<li>* Third party scooter insurance: this is the minimum level of insurance required by law. If youre involved in an accident, this will cover the costs of any damage to the third party, their vehicle or property but it doesnt cover your own costs. Third party insurance is the cheapest option but if your scooter is damaged youll have to pay for any necessary repairs or replacement out of your own pocket.</li>

<li>* Third party fire and theft: this level of insurance offers some additional protection to the policy above and will cover you if your scooter is stolen or damaged in a fire.</li>

<li>* Comprehensive scooter insurance: as the name suggests, this is the most complete level of protection. In addition to what is protected under the policies above, youll be covered for any damages to your scooter and any injuries you sustain in an accident. This policy, which is likely to be the most expensive of the three, gives you total peace of mind, no matter what happens.</li>

</ul>

<br />
<h2>How to reduce the cost of your scooter insurance</h2>
<br />
<p>When working out scooter insurance premiums, insurers take into account a range of factors such as your age, where you live, and occupation. While you cant do anything about your age and are unlikely to move to another area or change jobs just to shave a few pounds off the cost of your insurance, there are a number of things you can do to help bring down the overall premium without compromising on your protection. Here are our top tips.</p>

<br />
<h2>Increase you excess</h2>
<br />
<p>All insurance polices come with a compulsory excess element, which is the amount you pay towards any claim you make in future. You have the option of increasing your voluntary excess which will bring down the overall cost of your scooter insurance, but remember this is likely to rule out claims for minor damages or costs, so weigh up the pros and cons carefully first.</p>



<br />

<h2>Work or pleasure? </h2><br />
<p>
If you use your scooter for getting to and from work on a daily basis, or use it for business purposes ( doing deliveries etc.) you can expect to pay a higher annual premium than if you only ride the scooter occasionally. It will usually be cheaper to insure a scooter if its for recreational use only.</p>




<br />
<h2>Decrease your annual mileage</h2>
<br />
<p>Insurers take into account your estimated annual mileage when working out your premium because basically, the more you ride your scooter, the greater the chances are that youll make a claim at some point. While its important to be completely honest about the number of miles you ride, you could reduce your premium by decreasing your annual mileage.</p>

<br />


<h2>Keep modifications to a minimum</h2>
<br />
<p>Insurance for a scooter that has been modified tend to incur a higher premium simply because theyre likelier to cost more to repair or replace in the event of an accident. If keeping the cost of your premium down is a priority, riding a standard scooter is the better option.</p>

<br />

<h2>Ride solo</h2><br />
<p>
You could reduce your annual premium by always riding your scooter alone. Remember that its against the law to carry a passenger on your scooter without appropriate insurance so be honest about declaring you ride solo.</p>

<br />



<h2>Multi riders</h2>
<br />
<p>Some insurers have special offers for multi-rider policies, but much will depend on who the other named riders are. Adding an older rider with no previous motoring convictions will cost less than insuring a younger rider with a poor riding history, so think carefully about who you choose to add to your policy .</p>

<div id="content_new_2">
	<h2>Weigh up all the costs before buying</h2>
<br />
	<p>Knowing how much your yearly insurance is likely to cost can help you decide on the type of scooter or moped you want to buy. Scooters up to 125cc and 50cc mopeds will be cheaper to insure than more powerful models, but there are other factors that determine how much your scooter insurance will cost. Its important to always provide honest, accurate and up to date information when you complete your online application before clicking to get a quote. That way, youll know exactly how much insurance will cost by comparing the best prices and deals, and whether the policy includes extra options such as leathers and helmet cover, breakdown assistance, legal assistance, and personal accident cover.</p>
<br />
	<h2>Name your scooter, retrieve your quote</h2>
<br />

With Scoot Scoot you can do just that, so whether youre the proud new owner of a twist-and-go 50cc model, a 125cc run-around, or a full accessorised classic model, youll be able to create the kind of scooter insurance cover that best matches your usage by using our online tool. Some of the benefits to look out for include:</p>

	<li>* Special offers on scooter insurance</li>
	<li>* Special policies for multi riders</li>

<br />

	<h2>Shop around with Scoot Scoot</h2>
<br />
<p>Use our independent and impartial comparison service site to do the shopping around for you by searching over 40 insurers to find the best scooter and moped insurance deals available in the UK - saving you time and money in the process!</p>

<br />

<h2>Choose the scooter thats right for you</h2>
<br />
<p>If youre planning to use your scooter for commuting in an urban setting, youre unlikely to need maximum engine capacity and a 125cc will be more economical to run, as well as to insure. High performance scooters will cost more to insure because insurers know that statistically, claims are more likely, as well as more costly, with these type of machines.</p>
<br />

<h2>Always ride safely</h2>
<br />
<p>It goes without saying that you should always ride safely for your own sake and out of consideration for other road users, but how you ride can also affect your insurance premium. If you have previous riding convictions insurers will see you as a higher risk and ask you to pay more for your scooter insurance.</p>

<br />

<h2>Limit your claims</h2>
<br />
<p>You can earn attractive discounts if you have zero claims on your policy and the longer youve gone without making a claim, the greater this discount can be, adding up to huge savings on your premium. Its definitely worth bearing this in mind before making a claim if you have a minor accident with your scooter. Paying for the damage yourself may be the better option, rather than losing out on a no claims discount further down the road.</p>

<br />

<h2>Add security to your scooter</h2>
<br />
<p>Where you keep or park your scooter when not in use can affect your insurance, so if possible keep it in a locked garage or shed rather than on the street. Make sure you minimise the risk of the scooter being stolen by fitting an alarm, locks, anchors, chains, or an immobiliser, and also adding security markings. The more secure your scooter, the less chance it has of been stolen or vandalised, decreasing the need to make a claim on your policy.</p>



<br />


<h2>Moped insurance</h2><br />

<p>No matter what make or model of moped you ride you can find the most competitive deal on moped insurance using the Scoot Scoot comparison site. As the UKs leading scooter insurance specialists  we only source and compare scooter insurance - we search across the market for the best moped insurance deals available, so that you dont have to!<br /><br />

Perhaps youre thinking about buying your first moped and want to factor in annual insurance costs, or you already own a moped and your existing policy is coming up for renewal. Whatever the reason, well help you find the type of moped insurance policy that is designed to meet your specific requirements. Insuring well known brands of moped such as Piaggio, Peugeot, or Vespa, are likely to be more expensive because of higher replacement and repair costs, but weve helped lots of customers find great insurance rates for these and other models.<br /><br />

Getting a moped insurance quote only takes a few minutes and youll only have to fill in one form to apply. If you need some help with the form or prefer to do it by phone, well be happy to help. Either way, simply provide some information about yourself, details of the make and model of the moped you want to insure, and the type of policy you need by selecting third party insurance, third party fire and theft, or fully comprehensive moped insurance. You can retrieve your free quote without having to wait and be able to see at a glance what your new policy will cost.</p>
<br />

<h2>Improve your skills</h2>
<br />
<p>Some insurers will offer special deals to riders who have enhanced road skills or qualifications. Organisations like the Royal Society for the Prevention of Accidents, the British Motorcyclists Federation, and the Institute of Advanced Motorists run special courses for motorcyclists. Youll have to pay for the course, but could cover your costs by what you save on scooter insurance in future.</p>
