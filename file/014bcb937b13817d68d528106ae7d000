<h1>Manage Your Profile</h1>
<h1>About You</h1>
<h2>How do I edit my profile or profile photo?</h2>
<p>You can edit information that appears on your JudoBNB profile, such as your main profile photo or email address. If you’re a host looking to make changes to your listing profile, learn how to <a href="#" target="_blank">edit your listing</a>.</p>
<p>To edit your profile information:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="#" target="_blank">Edit Profile</a> on judobnb.com.</li>
<li>Use the menu on the left to choose different sections of your profile to edit.</li>
</ol>
<p>The different sections of your profile include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit Profile</strong>: Update the basics about who you are and where you live, including the phone number and email address you’ll share when you have a confirmed reservation. Click <strong>Save</strong> at the bottom of the page to save your changes.</li>
<li><strong>Photos, Symbol, and Video</strong>: Upload a photo from your computer, or take one with your webcam. A photo that clearly shows your face is needed before booking or hosting a reservation.</li>
<li><strong>Trust and Verification</strong>: Add verifications to complete your <a href="#" target="_blank">Verified ID</a>, which is required by some hosts.</li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong>: After you complete a reservation, write and read reviews that have been left for you.</li>
<li><strong>References</strong>: To build trust in the community, you can request friends, family members, and colleagues to <a href="#" target="_blank">post a reference</a> on your profile explaining why you&#8217;re a great host or guest.</li>
</ul>
<p>To see what your profile looks like to others, you can also click <strong>View Profile</strong>.</p>
<h2>Why do I need to have an JudoBNB profile or profile photo?</h2>
<p>Your profile is a great way for others to learn more about you before they book your space or host you. When your profile is robust, it helps others feel that you&#8217;re reliable, authentic, and committed to the spirit of JudoBNB. Whether you&#8217;re a host or a guest, the more complete your profile is, the more reservations you&#8217;re likely to book, too.</p>
<p>We require all hosts to have a profile photo, and we require all guests to upload a profile photo before making their first reservation.</p>
<p>A great profile includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>At least one profile photo</li>
<li>Multiple <a href="#">verifications</a> and a Verified ID</li>
<li>A description of at least 50 words highlighting why you decided to join the JudoBNB community, your interests or hobbies, or anything else you think someone would want to know</li>
</ul>
<p>To view someone&#8217;s profile, just click their profile photo.</p>
<h2>How do I make a profile video?</h2>
<p>To record a profile video using your webcam:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>Photos, Symbol, and Video</strong> on the left</li>
<li>Click <strong>Record a new video</strong> and follow the instructions</li>
</ol>
<p>You can use a profile video to express yourself to the JudoBNB community and make a great first impression. We recommend you start with your first name and where you’re from, and then let us know your interests, a fun fact about yourself, or why you love JudoBNB.</p>
<p>At this time, we don&#8217;t support uploading saved videos from your computer, or uploading videos to your listing&#8217;s page.</p>
<h1>Verifications</h1>
<h2>What are profile verifications and how do I get them?</h2>
<p>Profile verifications are a way to connect your JudoBNB profile to other information about you, such as your Facebook profile, phone number, email address, or photo ID.</p>
<h4>Adding verifications</h4>
<p>To add verifications to your account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Tap <strong>Trust and Verification</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>Add More Verifications</strong> choose a verification to add</li>
</ol>
<p>Certain verifications like <a href="#" target="_blank">reviews</a> and <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/297" target="_blank">professional photography</a> can&#8217;t be added from this page.</p>
<h4>Available verifications</h4>
<p>Available verifications include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Email address</strong>: Confirm that you receive email notifications and messages</li>
<li><strong>Phone number</strong>: We&#8217;ll share your verified phone number with your host or guest once a reservation is accepted</li>
<li><strong>Online ID</strong>: Connect your JudoBNB profile to Google, Facebook, LinkedIn, Verify with Amex, or by having pre-existing reviews</li>
<li><strong>Reviews</strong>: Build a reputation in the JudoBNB community from your Reviews tab after completing reservations</li>
<li><strong>Verified photos</strong>: We offer <a href="#">free professional photography</a> in many cities</li>
</ul>
<h4>Verified ID</h4>
<p>You may also want to get a <a href="#" target="_blank">Verified ID badge</a>. To get a Verified ID badge, go to the <strong>Trust and Verification</strong> area of your profile and click the <strong>Verify Me</strong> button or visit our <a href="#">Verified ID</a> page.</p>
<h2>What is Verified ID?</h2>
<p>We created the Verified ID process to build trust in our community and help give you more information when you&#8217;re deciding who to host or stay with.</p>
<h4>How Verified ID works</h4>
<p>Verified ID connects your JudoBNB profile with other information about you. As part of Verified ID, you might be asked to:</p>
<ol>
<li>Take a photo or upload an image of your government-issued ID, such as your driver&#8217;s license or passport. Depending on where you live, you may have the option of answering a few questions about yourself instead.</li>
<li>Connect another online profile to your JudoBNB account, such as a Facebook, Google, or LinkedIn account.</li>
<li>Upload an JudoBNB profile photo and provide a phone number and email address.</li>
</ol>
<p>Visit <a href="#" target="_blank">judobnb.com/verify</a> to get started at any time.</p>
<h4>When you&#8217;ll need to complete it</h4>
<p>Under certain circumstances, you might be required to complete Verified ID. For example, hosts can require that guests complete Verified ID before booking their place.</p>
<p>If your host requires you to complete Verified ID, you&#8217;ll be directed to complete the process right after you send your reservation request, and will have 12 hours to complete it. If you need to come back later, go to <a href="#" target="_blank">judobnb.com/verify</a> and pick up where you left off.</p>
<h4>The Verified ID badge</h4>
<p>When you complete Verified ID, you&#8217;ll earn a badge on your profile. Many hosts and guests look for this badge when deciding whether to host or stay with someone—but it&#8217;s not an endorsement or guarantee of someone&#8217;s identity.</p>
<h4>Privacy and encryption</h4>
<p>We take privacy seriously. The information you provide during this process is <a href="#">encrypted</a> and governed by our <a href="#">Privacy Policy</a>.</p>
<p>We won&#8217;t share the government ID or personal details you provide during Verified ID with your host or guest—they&#8217;ll only know that you’ve successfully completed the process. And we’ll never post to your Facebook, Google, LinkedIn, or other connected accounts without your permission.</p>
<h2>How do I verify my phone number?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To verify your phone number:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com.</li>
<li>Next to <strong>Phone Number</strong>, click <strong>Add a phone number</strong>.</li>
<li>Use the drop-down menu to select your country, and we’ll automatically insert the right country code.</li>
<li>Enter your area code and phone number.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Verify via SMS</strong> or <strong>Verify via Call</strong>. We&#8217;ll send you a 4-digit code via text message (SMS) or an automated phone call.</li>
<li>Enter your code and click <strong>Verify</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you don’t see a confirmation message, try refreshing the page. If the method you chose isn&#8217;t working, try the other one.</p>
<p>After verifying your phone number, you can manage <a href="#">text message notifications</a> by going to <strong><a href="#">Account</a></strong> and choosing <strong>Notifications</strong> on the left. As always, standard message and data rates may apply for any calls or messages sent or received. For questions about these rates, get in touch with your phone provider.</p>
<h4>Why verify?</h4>
<p>Having a verified phone number gives your hosts, guests, and JudoBNB a way to contact you about your reservations or your account. Hosts are required to verify their phone numbers before listing their homes, and guests must have a verified phone number before booking a reservation. You also need a verified phone number to complete <a href="#">Verified ID</a>.</p>
<h2>Is verifying my ID secure?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>The information you provide JudoBNB during the <a href="#" target="_blank">Verified ID</a> process is governed by our <a href="#" target="_blank">Privacy Policy</a> and transmitted using SSL—the same secure encryption that websites use to transmit credit card numbers.</p>
<p>When we receive information from your driver’s license or passport, we store the number in an encrypted form, so you should only have to verify your ID once. For countries with knowledge-based authentication, we don&#8217;t store the questions or your answers.</p>
<p>Only a small number of authorized JudoBNB employees are allowed access to your original documentation for troubleshooting or internal purposes.</p>
<p>Our third-party partners store information from the Verified ID process according to our written instructions and under our Privacy Policy.</p>
</div>
<h2>Why didn&#8217;t I receive my email notification?</h2>
<p>If you didn’t receive an email notification from us, there are a few different steps you can try to figure out the issue.</p>
<h4>Make sure your email address is correct</h4>
<p>We might be sending emails to an old or incorrect email address. To check the email being used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>Edit Profile</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Look for the Email Address field. Make sure your address is correct.</li>
<li>If it’s incorrect, add the correct address, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Check your email notification settings</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ll only send the emails you tell us you want. Check your notification settings to make sure you haven&#8217;t opted out of the email type you&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>Notification Settings.</strong></a></li>
<li>Look for the &#8220;Email Settings&#8221; field. Make sure you’ve chosen the email types you want to receive.</li>
<li>After adding or removing checkmarks from the right boxes, scroll to the bottom of the page and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Search all messages in your email inbox</h4>
<p>Sometimes emails can get lost in your inbox. In your email account, search for terms like &#8220;JudoBNB&#8221;, &#8220;reservation&#8221;, &#8220;verification&#8221;, or other words related to the email you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<h4>Check your spam and other email filters</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s possible your email provider mistakenly sent our messages to your spam or junk folder. To avoid this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove JudoBNB messages from your spam list</li>
<li>Add <strong>automated@judobnb.com</strong>, <strong>express@judobnb.com</strong>, and <strong>response@judobnb.com</strong> to your personal email address book</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other filters or routing rules in your email account that may have sorted JudoBNB emails elsewhere, be sure to check those, too.</p>
<h4>Check for issues with your email service provider</h4>
<p>Depending on your provider, emails can take up to a few hours to be delivered. If undelivered or delayed emails continue to be an issue, check with your provider to see if there are any configuration issues or problems with their network that might be affecting your account.</p>
<h1>Superhost</h1>
<h2>What is a Superhost?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p><a href="#">Superhosts</a> are experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests.</p>
<p>Once a host reaches Superhost status, a badge will automatically appear on their listing and profile to help you identify them.</p>
<p>We check Superhosts’ activity four times a year, to ensure that the program highlights the people who are most dedicated to providing outstanding hospitality.</p>
<p>The <a href="#">Superhost Terms &amp; Conditions</a> apply. JudoBNB doesn&#8217;t endorse or sponsor any host, including Superhosts, or their listings.</p>
<h2>How do I become a Superhost?</h2>
<p>To become a <a href="#">Superhost</a>, you need to have an account in good standing, and over the past year you must have:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hosted at least 10 trips</li>
<li>Maintained a 90% response rate or higher</li>
<li>Received a 5-star review at least 80% of the time you’ve been reviewed, as long as at least half of the guests who stayed with you left a review</li>
<li>Completed each of your confirmed reservations without canceling</li>
</ul>
<p>You don’t need to apply to become a Superhost. If you meet the program requirements on the assessment date, you&#8217;ll qualify for Superhost status. We’ll notify you of your Superhost status at the end of each assessment period—usually 10 days after the assessment begins.</p>
<p>You can track your progress in the <a href="#">Superhost section of your dashboard</a>.</p>
<h4>Measuring your activity</h4>
<p>The Superhost requirements are measured every 3 months, and are based on your activity over the past year. The assessment dates are the first of the month in January, April, July, and October. If you meet the program requirements on the assessment date, you&#8217;ll qualify for Superhost status, though it may take a couple days for your Superhost badge to appear on your listing. This process is automated, which means we can&#8217;t update your status in between assessment dates.</p>
<p>Keep in mind that you’ll need to continue to meet the program qualifications to maintain your Superhost status on the next assessment date.</p>
<h4>Superhost response rate</h4>
<p>In your progress toward receiving Superhost status, we look at your response rate for a longer period of time than the one we use to <a href="#">calculate</a> the response rate that appears on your listing, where guests can see it.</p>
<p>On your listing, your response rate is based on the responses you send within 24 hours to the reservation requests and booking inquiries you’ve received in the past 30 days. The response rate in the Superhost section of your dashboard is based on the responses you send within 24 hours to the reservation requests and booking inuqiries you&#8217;ve received in the past 365 days. We use a longer period of time to determine your Superhost status, because having it should reflect a year-round commitment to providing outstanding hospitality.</p>
<h4>Star reviews</h4>
<p>The requirement that you receive a 5-star review at least 80% of the time is based on the primary reviews you’ve received from guests, not the individual category reviews that you see directly above the written reviews on your listing page.</p>
<p>Keep in mind the number of stars you see at the top of your listing page is rounded to the nearest half of a star, and it’s a cumulative average of the primary reviews you’ve received since you started hosting. Those stars don’t represent the percentage of 5-star reviews you’ve received in the past year—the only place to find the percentage is in the <a href="#">Superhost section</a> of your dashboard.</p>
<p>If you’ve received 5-star reviews 80% of the time or more, but fewer than half of your guests have left you a review, you won&#8217;t receive Superhost status.</p>
<h4>Extenuating circumstances</h4>
<p>Cancellations you make under <a href="#">extenuating circumstances</a> won’t count against your Superhost status, but all other cancellations will. We can&#8217;t mark previous cancellations as &#8220;made under extenuating circumstances,&#8221; unless they&#8217;re reported to us within two weeks of the cancellation.</p>
<p><a href="#">Superhost Terms &amp; Conditions</a></p>
<p>JudoBNB doesn&#8217;t endorse or sponsor any host, including Superhosts, or their listings.</p>
<h2>What benefits do Superhosts receive?</h2>
<p>If you earn <a href="#">Superhost status</a>, potential guests will see a Superhost badge on your host profile and each of your listings.</p>
<h4>Other benefits</h4>
<p>Superhosts are also rewarded with:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Priority support</strong>: You’ll receive priority phone support whenever you <a href="#">call JudoBNB</a> or tweet <a href="#">@JudoBNBHelp</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Search filter</strong>: A Superhost search filter lets guests search only for recognized hosts like you.</li>
<li><strong>Travel coupon</strong>: If you maintain your Superhost status for a full year (4 evaluation periods) and have an active listing on the day that marks the 1 year anniversary of your Superhost status, you’ll receive a $100 travel coupon to use towards your own JudoBNB trip. Learn how to <a href="#">apply this coupon</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Product exclusives</strong>: You&#8217;ll be invited to preview upcoming releases and attend exclusive events.</li>
</ul>
<h2>What’s the Superhost section of my dashboard?</h2>
<p>The Superhost section of your dashboard helps you track your progress toward <a href="#">becoming a Superhost</a>—a host who receives <a href="#">a badge and other benefits</a> for providing outstanding hospitality.</p>
<p>The Superhost section of your dashboard shows:</p>
<ul>
<li>The number of trips you’ve hosted</li>
<li>Your response rate over the last year</li>
<li>The % of 5-star primary reviews you&#8217;ve received</li>
<li>The number of confirmed reservations that you’ve canceled</li>
</ul>
<p>Your dashboard automatically reflects your activity from the past year, but in some instances it may take a day or two for your dashboard to reflect your most recent trips. It also tells you when the next Superhost assessment date will be.</p>
<p>If you meet the program <a href="#">requirements</a> on the assessment date, you&#8217;ll qualify for Superhost status. Keep in mind that you’ll need to continue to meet the program qualifications to maintain your Superhost status on the next assessment date.</p>
<h2>Can I lose my Superhost status?</h2>
<p>Superhosts are evaluated 4 times a year. During each assessment period, hosts can gain, keep, or lose their <a href="#">Superhost status</a> based on their activity within the last year.</p>
<p>To keep your Superhost status, you must continue to meet <a href="#">the Superhost requirements</a>during each assessment period.</p>
<p>You can track your progress in the <a href="#">Superhost section of your dashboard</a>.</p>
<h1>References &amp; Referrals</h1>
<h2>How do references work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts and guests can receive public references from friends, family members, and colleagues to help build their profile. References help people throughout the JudoBNB community get to know you, and feel more comfortable booking a reservation with you.</p>
<p>You need an JudoBNB account to request and write references, and references will only display on the recipient’s profile if the author of the reference has a profile photo.</p>
<p>To request a reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="#">Profile</a> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>References</strong> on the left</li>
<li>Use the <strong>Request References</strong> section to send emails to the people you want to get a reference from</li>
</ol>
<p>In the <strong>References About You</strong> section, you&#8217;ll see references that you’ve received. You have to approve each reference before it will appear on your profile.</p>
<p>In the <strong>References By You</strong> section, you’ll see reference requests you’ve received. The only way you can write a reference for someone else in the JudoBNB community is in response to a reference request—you can’t proactively leave a reference for someone.</p>
<p>References are different from <a href="#">reviews</a>, which hosts and guests write after a completed trip. </p>
</div>
<h2>How do referrals and travel credits work?</h2>
<p>Inviting people to JudoBNB can earn you—and the people you invite—travel credit to use toward a new reservation.</p>
<h4>Invite friends to use JudoBNB</h4>
<p>To begin earning credit, visit the <a href="#" target="_blank">invitation page</a> and send the link to your friends. When a friend clicks the link, they will receive credit that will automatically apply towards their first reservation with JudoBNB. The credit will show up automatically on the checkout page of any qualifying reservation.</p>
<p>When your friend completes their first qualifying reservation, you&#8217;ll earn travel credit to use for your own JudoBNB reservations. You&#8217;ll receive your travel credit after the departure date of your friend&#8217;s trip.</p>
<p>For each person you refer, there are two opportunities to earn travel credit. You earn credit when your friend completes a qualifying reservation as a guest and also when they complete a qualifying reservation as a host. You can earn up to $5,000 USD in travel credit overall.</p>
<p>To see all of your current referral details, click <strong>Invite Friends</strong> on your JudoBNB Dashboard. <a href="#" target="_blank">Terms apply</a>.</p>
<h4>Qualifying reservations</h4>
<p>A qualifying reservation usually has a total value of $100 USD or more, excluding guest fees and any taxes. These amounts may vary during promotional periods.</p>
<h4>Use your travel credit</h4>
<p>Your available travel credits automatically appear as a coupon on the checkout page of your reservation request. If the travel credits aren&#8217;t automatically added, it means the reservation doesn’t qualify.</p>
<p>Travel credits can&#8217;t apply to a trip that has already been paid for, but they will be available and applied to your next qualifying reservation. They expire one year from the date they&#8217;re issued and can only be used once. They’re also not reusable if you cancel a reservation where the credits were applied.</p>
<h2>Why isn&#8217;t a reference appearing on my profile?</h2>
<p>After you receive a <a href="#">reference</a> from another member of the JudoBNB community, you&#8217;ll need to approve it before it will appear on your profile. You&#8217;ll receive an email and an alert on your <strong>Dashboard</strong> when you receive a reference. You can also go directly to the reference:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>References</strong> on the left</li>
</ol>
<p>References will only display on your profile if the author of the reference has a profile photo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> References are different from <a href="#">reviews</a>, which hosts and guests write after a completed trip, and <a href="#">referrals</a>, which let you earn credit for inviting people to JudoBNB.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>References</strong> on the left</li>
</ol>
<p>References will only display on your profile if the author of the reference has a profile photo.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> References are different from <a href="#">reviews</a>, which hosts and guests write after a completed trip, and <a href="#">referrals</a>, which let you earn credit for inviting people to JudoBNB.</p>
<h1>Security &amp; Password</h1>
<h2>How do I reset my password?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you&#8217;ve forgotten your password or are having trouble logging in to your JudoBNB account, visit: <a href="#">www.judobnb.com/forgot_password</a></p>
<p>Enter the email address you use for JudoBNB, and you&#8217;ll be emailed a link to reset your password.</p>
<h4>I want to update my password</h4>
<p>If you know your current password, but you want to change it:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Account</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>Security</strong> on the left.</li>
<li>Under <strong>Change Your Password</strong> enter your password and follow the instructions on screen</li>
</ol>
<h4>I use Facebook to log in, but I want to create a JudoBNB password</h4>
<p>If you created a JudoBNB account by connecting to Facebook, you weren&#8217;t required to create a password.</p>
<p>You can continue to log in via Facebook, or if you&#8217;d like to create a JudoBNB password, first log out of your JudoBNB account, then follow the steps as if you forgot your password. Once you create a JudoBNB password, you&#8217;ll no longer be able to sign in using Facebook, but your JudoBNB account will still be <a href="#">connected to Facebook</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I change the email address I use for JudoBNB?</h2>
<p>To change the email address you use for your JudoBNB account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/edit">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Next to <strong>Email Address</strong>, enter the email address you want to use</li>
<li>Scroll to the bottom of the page and click <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your email address can only be associated with one JudoBNB account at a time. If you get a notification that your email address is already in use but you can&#8217;t remember your password for that account, you can <a href="#">reset your password</a>.</p>
<h1>Notifications</h1>
<h2>How do text message and push notifications work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<h4>Text message (SMS) notifications</h4>
<p>We can let you know when you have new JudoBNB messages, reservation requests, and more via text message (SMS) alerts. These notifications may be sent at any time, based on your notification settings.</p>
<p>To turn text message notifications on or off and manage the types of mobile notifications you receive, visit the notifications menu in your account settings.</p>
<p>In the JudoBNB app on your phone or tablet:</p>
<ol>
<li>In the JudoBNB app, tap the profile icon <i class="icon icon-user-circle"></i>.</li>
<li>Tap <strong>Settings &gt; Notifications</strong>.</li>
<li>Manage your notifications.</li>
</ol>
<p>On the web:</p>
<ol>
<li>Click your name in the top-right corner of judobnb.com.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Account</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Notifications</strong> in the menu on the left side of your screen.</li>
<li>Look for the <strong>Mobile Notifications / Text Messages</strong> pane. You can manage your settings here.</li>
</ol>
<p>When you opt in to text message (SMS) notifications, we&#8217;ll send you a text to confirm your signup.</p>
<p>We only support sending SMS on carriers in North America and Europe. Standard message and data rates may apply for any messages sent or received, so it&#8217;s best to contact your wireless provider to confirm. Participating carriers: AT&amp;T, CBW, nTelos, Sprint, Nextel, Boost, Virgin Mobile, Verizon Wireless, T-Mobile, and Alltel.</p>
<h4>Push notifications</h4>
<p>If you use <a href="#" target="_blank">Judobnb&#8217;s mobile app</a>, we can also send push notifications straight to your smart phone. You can enable them from the app&#8217;s Settings menu.</p>
<h2>What is a trusted browser?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you turn on login notifications, you can mark the browser you use to access your JudoBNB account often as trusted—when you use a trusted browser to access your account, we won’t notify you.</p>
<p>To mark a browser as trusted:</p>
<ol>
<li>Enable login notifications.</li>
<li>Log in to your JudoBNB account from the browser you want to trust.</li>
<li>You’ll see a <strong>Add to trusted browsers?</strong> window appear. Select the option next to <strong>Trust this browser</strong>.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>You should only mark a browser as trusted if you&#8217;re on a private computer or phone.</p>
<h2>What are login notifications?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">Login notifications are an extra security feature that can help alert you if someone accesses your JudoBNB account without your permission.</p>
<p>When you turn on login notifications, we’ll send you an email each time someone logs ins. In these emails, we’ll give you information on the type of Internet browser used to access your account, the time your account was accessed, and where we believe it was accessed from.</p>
<p>To turn login notifications on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Account</a></strong></li>
<li>Select <strong>Security</strong> on the left</li>
<li>Look for <strong>Login Notifications</strong> and click the check box next to <strong>Enable login notifications</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you use certain browsers often, you can <a href="#">mark them as trusted</a>. We won’t notify you when your account is accessed from a trusted browser.</p>
<h2>Why didn&#8217;t I receive my email notification?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you didn’t receive an email notification from us, there are a few different steps you can try to figure out the issue.</p>
<h4>Make sure your email address is correct</h4>
<p>We might be sending emails to an old or incorrect email address. To check the email being used:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/edit" target="_blank"><strong>Edit Profile</strong></a>.</li>
<li>Look for the Email Address field. Make sure your address is correct.</li>
<li>If it’s incorrect, add the correct address, scroll to the bottom of the page, and click<strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Check your email notification settings</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ll only send the emails you tell us you want. Check your notification settings to make sure you haven&#8217;t opted out of the email type you&#8217;re looking for:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/users/notifications" target="_blank"><strong>Notification Settings.</strong></a></li>
<li>Look for the &#8220;Email Settings&#8221; field. Make sure you’ve chosen the email types you want to receive.</li>
<li>After adding or removing checkmarks from the right boxes, scroll to the bottom of the page and click <strong>Save</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<h4>Search all messages in your email inbox</h4>
<p>Sometimes emails can get lost in your inbox. In your email account, search for terms like &#8220;JudoBNB&#8221;, &#8220;reservation&#8221;, &#8220;verification&#8221;, or other words related to the email you&#8217;re looking for.</p>
<h4>Check your spam and other email filters</h4>
<p>It&#8217;s possible your email provider mistakenly sent our messages to your spam or junk folder. To avoid this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Remove JudoBNB messages from your spam list</li>
<li>Add <strong>automated@judobnb.com</strong>, <strong>express@judobnb.com</strong>, and <strong>response@judobnb.com</strong> to your personal email address book</li>
</ul>
<p>If you have other filters or routing rules in your email account that may have sorted JudoBNB emails elsewhere, be sure to check those, too.</p>
<h4>Check for issues with your email service provider</h4>
<p>Depending on your provider, emails can take up to a few hours to be delivered. If undelivered or delayed emails continue to be an issue, check with your provider to see if there are any configuration issues or problems with their network that might be affecting your account.</p>
<h1>Language &amp; Currency</h1>
<h2>Can I pay with any currency?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No. The currency you pay in is controlled by your country and payment method. It’s not possible to manually choose what currency you&#8217;ll use to pay.</p>
<p>When you select your country and payment method on the checkout page, the currency in which you&#8217;d be charged will be clearly displayed before you confirm your reservation request.</p>
<h4>Exchange rates and currency conversion</h4>
<p>When the currency you’re paying with is different from the host’s listing currency, we convert your payment automatically.</p>
<p>The base exchange rate uses data from one or more third parties, such as <a href="#">OANDA</a>. It’s updated regularly, but may not be identical to the real-time market rate. If you’re viewing the site and paying in your native currency (according to the billing address on your payment method) and that currency differs from the host&#8217;s chosen currency, we also charge a 3% conversion fee, which accounts for holding costs and currency risks.</p>
<p>If your payment includes this 3% conversion fee, we&#8217;ll let you know on the checkout page before you confirm your booking. The conversion fee is separate from and in addition to our <a href="#">guest service fee</a>. The conversion fee is applied to the reservation total after guest service fees have been added.</p>
<h4>Third-party fees</h4>
<p>If you pay in a currency that’s different from the designated currency of your payment method, your provider or third-party payment processor may apply a currency conversion rate or fees to your payment. Contact your provider (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) for information on what fees may apply, since they’re not controlled by JudoBNB.</p>
<h4>Currency view</h4>
<p>You can view JudoBNB listings in many currencies, but this won’t affect what currency you’ll be asked to pay in. To change your currency view, scroll to the bottom of any page on judobnb.com and click on the currency field to select what currency you want to view listing prices in.</p>
</div>
<h1>Connected Services</h1>
<h2>What is the Social Connections feature?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Social Connections shows you how you&#8217;re connected to others, either directly or through mutual friends, depending on your Facebook privacy settings. It also highlights your JudoBNB activity, which may include your username, Facebook profile photo, and recent locations you visited to your Facebook friends who are also on JudoBNB.</p>
<h4>Turn Social Connections on</h4>
<p>To turn Social Connections on:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>Trust and Verification</strong> on the left</li>
<li>Next to <strong>Facebook</strong>, click <strong>Connect</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Turn Social Connections off</h4>
<p>To turn Social Connections off:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#" target="_blank">Privacy</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Uncheck the box next to <strong>Share my activity with my Facebook friends that are also on JudoBNB</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save Social Connections</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>If you turn Social Connections off, your JudoBNB account will still be connected to Facebook, but your JudoBNB activity won&#8217;t be shared with your Facebook friends on JudoBNB. Your public JudoBNB activity, such as Wish Lists you&#8217;ve created or reviews you&#8217;ve written, will still be shown to other people on JudoBNB.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;ve enabled Social Connections but don&#8217;t see any connections, it might be that your Facebook friends aren&#8217;t active yet on JudoBNB. <a href="#" target="_blank">Refer them</a> to earn travel credits.</p>
<h2>How do I connect my Facebook and JudoBNB accounts?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To connect your JudoBNB and Facebook accounts:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Profile</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>Trust and Verification</strong> on the left</li>
<li>Under <strong>Add More Verifications</strong>, find Facebook and click <strong>Connect</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>To disconnect your accounts, follow the steps above to get to Trust and Verification, then under <strong>Your Current Verifications</strong>, find Facebook and click <strong>Disconnect</strong>.</p>
<p>Connecting your JudoBNB and Facebook accounts helps personalize your JudoBNB experience. Based on your Facebook privacy settings, you&#8217;ll be able to filter searches by <a href="#">Social Connections</a> to show listings that your friends have reviewed, or where you have mutual friends with a host.</p>
<p>Connecting with Facebook also adds the Online ID <a href="#">verification</a> to your profile, and can help fill out other sections like School and Work. You can edit your profile at any time to modify or remove this information. You&#8217;ll still keep the Online ID verification.</p>
<h1>Troubleshooting</h1>
<h2>Which Internet browsers work best on JudoBNB?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>For the best experience using the JudoBNB site, we suggest using the most up-to-date version of <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome" target="_blank">Google Chrome</a> or <a href="https://mozilla.org/firefox" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a>.</p>
<p>Browser developers frequently make improvements to provide you with a faster, more secure online experience. Newer browsers also support a wider range of designs and features than older browsers.</p>
<p>If you prefer to use Internet Explorer, please <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">upgrade to IE9 or higher</a>. Many features of the JudoBNB website don&#8217;t work with older versions of Internet Explorer—and we often can&#8217;t provide technical support if you&#8217;re using an outdated browser.</p>
<h2>What should I do if I need help with one of my Host Assist apps?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Host Assist apps and products are offered by different companies who have partnered with JudoBNB. If you’re having trouble, you should contact the customer service team for the company offering the app.</p>
<p>Want more information on Host Assist? <a href="#">Learn more</a></p>
<h2>Why was my listing deactivated?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To help make sure guests aren’t contacting you if you&#8217;re unable to host, and to preserve your <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/430">response rate</a>, your listing may be deactivated:</p>
<ul>
<li>If you let 4 consecutive reservation requests or booking inquiries expire</li>
<li>If you decline consecutive reservation requests and booking inquiries over an extended period of time</li>
<li>If you consistently take more than 7 days to pre-approve an inquiry</li>
</ul>
<h4>Reactivate your listing</h4>
<p>If your listing is temporarily deactivated, you’ll receive an email with instructions on how to reactivate it. You can also reactivate your listing at anytime from <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/dashboard">your dashboard</a>. It may take up to an hour for your listing to appear in search results after it has been reactivated.</p>

<h2>Deciding to Host</h2>
<h2>Are there any restrictions about what can be listed?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>JudoBNB welcomes many different kinds of listings on our site as long as they meet the following criteria:</p>
<ul>
<li>The space is only used for lodging</li>
<li>The space, if a mobile home, sailboat, yacht, or other vessel, will be semi-permanently attached to a set location during the reservation</li>
<li>The space is accurately represented, located where the host says it is, and is bookable by the host</li>
</ul>
<p>Listings that don’t meet these criteria include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Motor vehicles or watercraft intended for mobile use</li>
<li>Any listing whose primary purpose isn’t serving as a lodging</li>
</ul>
<p>If we discover a listing that doesn’t meet our guidelines, we may exercise our discretion to limit, suspend, deactivate, or cancel the host&#8217;s account. Refer to our <a href="#">Terms of Service</a> for more information and other requirements for listing your space on JudoBNB.</p>
<h2>Who can host on JudoBNB?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Almost anyone can be a host! It&#8217;s free to sign up and list your space. The listings available on the site are as diverse as the hosts who list them, so you can post airbeds in apartments, entire houses, rooms in bed-and-breakfasts, tree houses in the woods, boats on the water, or enchanted castles. Find out more about <a href="#">room types</a> to see how to describe your space.</p>
<p>You can list your space in almost any location worldwide. While we would like to keep the JudoBNB marketplace open to the entire world, we are required to comply with international regulations that restrict the use of our site by residents of certain countries.</p>
<h3>Why can&#8217;t I use JudoBNB from my location?</h3>
<p>JudoBNB is required to comply with international regulations that restrict the use of our site by residents of certain countries. Because of this, our services are not available in Crimea, Iran, Sudan, Syria, and North Korea.</p>
<p>If you&#8217;re an existing customer traveling in one of these countries and are need of assistance, please contact us via email at: <a href="#">trust@judobnb.com</a></p>
<h2>Can I require guests to be verified before booking?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts can require guests to complete JudoBNB&#8217;s <a href="#">Verified ID process</a>. In order to require Verified ID, you must first <a href="#">verify your own ID</a>.</p>
<p>To set reservation requirements:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> page</li>
<li>Click <strong>Reservation Requirements</strong> in the menu on the left side of your screen</li>
<li>Check the box next to <strong>Require guests to go through verification</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Save Reservation Requirements</strong></li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Can I use a host management service?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Host management services are third-party companies that assist with hosting responsibilities like key exchanges, cleanings, and listing management—they&#8217;re not affiliated with JudoBNB.</p>
<p>If you choose to use a host management service, you&#8217;ll be held to the same standards and policies as other JudoBNB community members.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8">
<h2>My neighbor is an JudoBNB host. What do I need to know?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>We consider neighbors a part of the JudoBNB community. Here&#8217;s some information about our service, and a way for you to share feedback with us.</p>
<h4>JudoBNB takes trust seriously</h4>
<p>We&#8217;re committed to helping our community build and maintain trust. That&#8217;s why we&#8217;ve provided tools to help our community make the right decisions when it comes to hosting or traveling. Read more about our <a href="#">Trust and Safety initiatives</a>.</p>
<h4>JudoBNB encourages responsibility</h4>
<p>We encourage hosts to think carefully about their responsibilities. We understand that hosting comes with a commitment to neighbors and to the community. Read more about our take on <a href="#">responsible hosting</a>.</p>
<h4>Neighbor hotline</h4>
<p>We&#8217;ve opened a toll-free neighbor hotline for our community. If you&#8217;re a neighbor of an JudoBNB host in the US and need to get in touch with us, call <strong>1-888-927-4459</strong>. If you have more general questions about how JudoBNB works, browse our <a href="#">Help Center</a> or <a href="#">contact us</a>.</p>
<h2>What legal and regulatory issues should I consider before hosting on JudoBNB?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>When deciding whether to become an JudoBNB host, it&#8217;s important for you to understand how the laws work in your city.</p>
<p>Some cities have laws that restrict your ability to host paying guests for short periods. These laws are often part of a city&#8217;s zoning or administrative codes. In many cities, you must register, get a permit, or obtain a license before you list your property or accept guests. Certain types of short-term bookings may be prohibited altogether. Local governments vary greatly in how they enforce these laws. Penalties may include fines or other enforcement.</p>
<p>These rules can be confusing. We&#8217;re working with governments around the world to clarify these rules so that everyone has a clear understanding of what the laws are. </p>
<p>In some tax jurisdictions, JudoBNB will take care of calculating, collecting, and remitting local occupancy tax on your behalf. Occupancy tax is calculated differently in every jurisdiction, and we’re moving as quickly as possible to extend this benefit to more hosts around the globe.</p>
<p>In the meantime, please review your local laws before listing your space on JudoBNB. More information about your city&#8217;s laws and regulations may be available on our <a href="#" target="_blank">Responsible Hosting page</a> in the <strong>Your City&#8217;s Regulations</strong> section.</p>
<p>By accepting our <a href="#">Terms of Service</a> and activating a listing, you certify that you will follow your local laws and regulations.</p>
<h2>Can I install video or audio surveillance in my listing?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>We expect hosts to respect their guests’ privacy. You must notify your guests about any security cameras or other surveillance devices at or around your listing, and get consent where required.</p>
<p>The use of surveillance equipment may also be against the law in some places, so make sure you understand your local regulations.</p>
<h2>What are some things I should consider before hosting long-term guests?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>In most states and localities in the United States, guests who stay in a home or apartment for approximately 30 days—the exact number depends on jurisdiction—may establish rights as a tenant. Generally, this means that local tenancy laws could protect them, and you may not be able to remove them from your property without proceeding through required eviction processes in court.</p>
<p>For example, in California, Illinois, and New York, a residential tenancy may be created after 30 consecutive days of occupancy. Someone who stays with you for fewer than 30 days generally does not have the rights of a tenant unless there is a written agreement to the contrary, but every state is different.</p>
<p>Local laws may differ from state laws regarding residential tenancies. We encourage you to review your local rules and regulations before accepting a long-term reservation.</p>
<h4>Guests who refuse to leave—and how JudoBNB can help</h4>
<p>These situations are incredibly rare, but if they happen, we&#8217;ll work with you to try and help resolve the problem with your guest. Should you face such a situation, <a href="#">let our 24/7 support team know</a> as soon as possible and we&#8217;ll get in touch with you.</p>
<h4>Asking guests to sign a rental agreement</h4>
<p>If you rent your home or apartment for more than 30 days, consider whether you want guests to sign a rental agreement. If so, you should make these requirements clear in your House Rules before finalizing a booking. Laws governing these subjects vary widely depending on where you live, so be sure to contact a landlord-tenant attorney familiar with your local laws and regulations.</p>
<h4>Local rent control laws</h4>
<p>Rent control is a special set of laws that includes limits on rent increases and eviction restrictions. Some local rent control laws may override state law, and while many states or local jurisdictions do not have rent control, other laws may still protect tenants. For these reasons, we recommend you contact your local Rent board, Department of Consumer Affairs, Attorney General, or other agencies to learn more about rent control and rent stabilization and how these rules might impact a long-term reservation.</p>
<h4>Evicting guests that overstay a long-term reservation</h4>
<p>Statutes exist in nearly all jurisdictions that permit landlords to use summary proceedings to evict tenants. A summary proceeding is a judicial proceeding that lets a landlord regain possession of leased property in an expedited fashion. You should contact a landlord-tenant attorney or your local county courts to learn more about eviction laws where you live, as they may affect your ability to evict a guest who overstays a long-term reservation.</p>

<h2>How should I talk to my neighbors, homeowners association, or landlord about JudoBNB?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Being a <a href="#">responsible host</a> means being a considerate tenant, neighbor, and community member. Here are a few things you should consider when talking with others about hosting on JudoBNB.</p>
<h4>Know the rules and regulations</h4>
<p>Before you start hosting, know what contracts and rules affect you, such as leases, condo board or co-op rules, HOA rules, or rules established by tenant organizations. Make sure you understand and comply with these rules before listing your space. Other <a href="#">laws in your city or state</a> may also affect you, so be sure to review them as well.</p>
<h4>Talk with your landlord or HOA</h4>
<p>Talk to your homeowner’s association or landlord about how often you plan to have guests, and how JudoBNB builds trust in its community. You can share information about JudoBNB’s<a href="#">trust and safety resources</a>, including community reviews and <a href="#">Verified ID</a>. Remind them that you only host people you feel comfortable with. If applicable in your country, you can also explain that JudoBNB offers a <a href="#">US$1M Host Guarantee</a>.</p>
<h4>Talk with your neighbors</h4>
<p>Neighbors may want to know about many of the same things as your landlord or HOA, as well as more specifics about upcoming bookings, such as names, dates, and other information about your guests. Making sure your neighbors are comfortable might help address some of your landlord’s concerns.</p>
<h4>Be a responsible host</h4>
<p>Here are some things you can do to show your landlord, HOA, and neighbors that you care about the property and your neighbors as much as they do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Set an occupancy limit to only allow groups of a certain size</li>
<li>Share your home and building rules with each guest</li>
<li>Provide your guests with phone numbers for emergency responders and a map of emergency exits and evacuation routes</li>
<li>Make sure you have a working smoke and carbon monoxide detector</li>
<li>Inform neighbors when a guest will be staying in your home</li>
<li>With your guests’ permission, share names or JudoBNB profile pages</li>
</ul>
<h1>Your Listings</h1>
<h1>List Your Space</h1>
<h2>How do star ratings work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>In addition to <a href="#">written reviews</a>, guests can submit an overall star rating and a set of category star ratings. Hosts can view their star ratings on their <strong><a href="#">Stats</a></strong> page, under <strong>Ratings from Guests</strong>. To see a breakdown of guest ratings by category, click <strong>Show Details</strong>.</p>
<p>Guests can give ratings on:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Overall Experience.</strong> What was your guest’s overall experience?</li>
<li><strong>Cleanliness.</strong> Did your guests feel that your space was clean and tidy?</li>
<li><strong>Accuracy.</strong> How accurately did your listing page represent your space?</li>
<li><strong>Value.</strong> Did your guest feel your listing provided good value for the price?</li>
<li><strong>Communication.</strong> How well did you communicate with your guest before and during their stay?</li>
<li><strong>Arrival.</strong> How smoothly did their check-in go?</li>
<li><strong>Location.</strong> How did guests feel about your neighborhood?</li>
</ul>
<p>In each category, you’ll be able to see how often you get 5 stars, how guests rated nearby hosts, and, in some cases, tips to help you improve your listing.</p>
<p>The number of stars displayed at the top of a listing page is an aggregate of the primary scores guests have given for that listing. At the bottom of a listing page there&#8217;s an aggregate for each category rating. A host needs to receive star ratings from at least 3 guests before their aggregate score appears.</p>

<h2>How do I add the type of bed to my listing?</h2>

<p><strong>Note</strong>: This feature is only available if your listing can accommodate more than 3 guests.</p>
<h2>How much should I charge for my listing?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<h4>Additional Fees</h4>
<ul>
<li><strong>Cleaning fee</strong>: You can either incorporate a cleaning fee into your nightly price or you can add a <a href="#">cleaning fee</a> in your pricing settings.</li>
<li><strong>Other fees</strong>: To charge extra fees outside of your rates (like a late check-in fee, pet fee, or bike rental fee), you must first disclose these potential charges to guests prior to booking and then use the Resolution Center to securely request payment for additional fees. JudoBNB is not responsible for the collection of payments on your behalf that are not incorporated into your pricing.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How can I share or embed my listing on other websites?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you&#8217;re a host, you can share your listing through different social media platforms or embed a preview of your listing on your website to reach people beyond those searching on JudoBNB.</p>
<h4>Share your listing on social media</h4>
<p>To share your listing on Facebook, Pinterest, Google+, or Twitter:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Click the name of the listing you want to share</li>
<li>On your listing&#8217;s page, under <strong>Save to Wishlist</strong> click <strong>&#8230; More</strong>.</li>
<li>Select the social media platform you want to use and follow the steps to share</li>

<li>Paste the HTML code into your website where you’d like your listing preview to appear.</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do I list multiple rooms?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you want to list multiple rooms in your house, you can create a separate listing for each space you have available. Each room will have it’s own calendar and listing page that should accurately reflect the number of beds and amenities, as well as what space will be shared with others.</p>
<p>To create a new listing, log in to judobnb.com and go to <a href="#">List your space</a>.</p>
<p>You can also create a listing for your whole house and separate listings for individual rooms in the house, but be sure to sync your calendars. If you rent your entire house, block those dates on all the individual rooms so you won&#8217;t double-book.</p>
<p>You can offer guests a discounted rate for booking multiple rooms by sending a <a href="#">Special Offer</a> and blocking the calendar of the other listings to avoid double-booking.</p>
<h2>What do the different room types mean?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>JudoBNB listings are categorized into the following room types:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Shared rooms</strong>: Guests share the entire space with you or others and don&#8217;t have a private room to themselves.</li>
<li><strong>Private rooms</strong>: Guests share some common areas with you, like the kitchen, living room, or bathroom, but they have their own private room for sleeping.</li>
<li><strong>Entire homes/apartments</strong>: Guests rent the entire unit and don&#8217;t have to share the space with you or with anyone else.</li>
</ul>
<p>As a host, you&#8217;re responsible for accurately describing your listing, so make sure you choose the appropriate room type.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I edit my listing?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To edit your listing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> on airbnb.com</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Listing and Calendar</strong> on the listing you want to edit</li>
<li>Hover on the left side of the page to open the menu</li>
<li>Click on the section of your listing that you want to edit.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a couple of other things to know about editing your listing:</p>
<ul>
<li>Some of your editing options (for example: calendar, reservation settings, and pricing) won&#8217;t appear until you&#8217;ve finished listing your space.</li>
<li>Edits only apply to reservations booked after you make the changes; they don&#8217;t apply to upcoming reservations that were already accepted.</li>
<li>While you edit, your changes will be automatically saved. Changes may take up to an hour to appear on your public listing.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<h2>What are house rules?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts share their House Rules to set expectations with their guests, like limits on smoking, areas beyond the listing space that are off-limits, and permission to have visitors.</p>
<p>To add or edit House Rules after you’ve listed your space:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> on airbnb.com</li>
<li>Click on the listing you want to edit</li>
<li>Hover on the left side of the page to open the menu</li>
<li>Under <strong>Hosting</strong>, click on <strong>Booking</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>House Rules</strong>, enter your expectations and rules for guests</li>
</ol>
<p>If a guest breaks a house rule, either before or during their stay, you can <a href="#">cancel their reservation</a> without penalty.</p>
<p>House rules appear on your listing page, and guests must review and agree to them before requesting a reservation. They’re also sent directly to a guest once they’ve a confirmed reservation.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I snooze or deactivate my listing?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you don’t want to receive any inquiries or requests, you can either snooze or deactivate your listing.</p>
<p>Turning your listing off doesn’t affect your confirmed reservations.</p>
<h4>Snooze your listing for a set period of time</h4>
<p>To pause your listing and hide it from search results for a set period of time:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms">Manage Listings</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Listing and Calendar</strong> on the listing you want to snooze</li>
<li>Select <strong>Snoozed</strong> in the drop-down menu on the bottom-left</li>
<li>Enter the <strong>Start date</strong> and <strong>End date</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Your listing will automatically reactivate when the timeframe you set is over. The day before your listing reactivates, you&#8217;ll get a reminder email.</p>
<h4>Temporarily deactivate your listing</h4>
<p>To deactivate your listing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Listing and Calendar</strong> on the listing you want to deactivate</li>
<li>Use the drop-down menu on the bottom-left to select <strong>Unlisted</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>You can reactivate your listing at any time from the <strong>Manage Listings</strong> page.</p>
<h4>Permanently deactivate your listing</h4>
<p>To permanently deactivate your listing:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to your <strong><a href="#">Manage Listings</a></strong> page</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Listing and Calendar</strong> on the listing you want to deactivate</li>
<li>Select <strong>Basics</strong> on the left-hand side of the screen</li>
<li>Click <strong>deactivate this listing</strong> at the bottom of the page</li>
</ol>
<p>You won&#8217;t be able to permanently deactivate your listing if you have any upcoming reservations or reservation requests. Past reviews of your listing will remain on your public profile—they cannot be removed.</p>
<p>If you would like to cancel your JudoBNB account entirely, <a href="#">learn how to cancel your account</a>.</p>
<h2>How do I set my map or address?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>You can edit the listing address or map location if they are incorrect. Your exact address will only be seen by guests with confirmed reservations.</p>
<h4>Edit your listing address</h4>
<p>To edit your listing address:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/rooms">Manage Listings</a></strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Click <strong>Manage Listing and Calendar</strong> on the listing you want to edit</li>

<li>Click <strong>Location</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Edit Address</strong> and complete the fields</li>
<li>Click <strong>Save Address</strong></li>
</ol>
<h4>Edit your listing’s location on the map</h4>

<li>Hover on the left side of the page to open the menu</li>
<li>Click <strong>Location</strong></li>
<li>Click on the map and drag it until the location pin is in the right spot</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to edit your address because you&#8217;ve moved to a new location or you&#8217;re listing a new space, you need to create a new listing rather than updating the address.</p>

<h2>Booking A Place</h2>
<h2>Contacting Hosts</h2>
<h2>What is the Judobnb cancellation policy?</h2>
<p>Judobnb allows hosts to choose among three standardized <a href="#">cancellation policies</a> (Flexible, Moderate, and Strict) that we enforce to protect both hosts and guests. A host&#8217;s cancellation policy can be found in the Prices section of their listing page. Guests must agree to the host&#8217;s cancellation policy when they make a reservation.</p>
<p>The Long Term cancellation policy applies to all reservations of 28 nights or more. Each listing and reservation on our site will clearly state the cancellation policy. Guests may cancel and review any penalties by viewing their travel plans and then clicking &#8216;Cancel&#8217; on the appropriate reservation.</p>
<h2>How do I book a place on Judobnb?</h2>
<p>When you book a place on Judobnb, you’re making arrangements to stay in someone’s home. Each host has their own style of hospitality, starting with how they like to get to know their guests. Some hosts want to approve reservations, while others are comfortable letting you book their place instantly without waiting for approval.</p>
<h4>1. Complete Your Profile</h4>
<p>In either case, it’s important to know that Judobnb is a community that relies on trust. Complete your profile before you request a reservation with a host, so they can know a little bit about you when they confirm. Your profile should include photos and verifications, especially because some hosts require guests to have a profile photo or Verified ID in order to book.</p>
<h4>2. Find the Right Place</h4>
<p>With over 800,000 unique listings around the world, you’ll want to make sure the place you choose has everything you need for a comfortable and memorable trip.</p>
<p>When searching for a place, make sure to include your dates and number of guests to get the most accurate pricing. Read reviews, descriptions, house rules, and amenities for each place to see if it’s the right fit for your trip. You can always contact the host if you have any questions about their home.</p>
<h4>3. Book It!</h4>
<p>You’ve found the perfect place, and now it’s time to make it official. This is where the host’s preferred way of booking will determine how you’ll confirm your reservation.</p>
<h5>Instant Book</h5>
<p>For hosts who don’t want to approve each reservation, you’ll see a button on their listing that says <strong>Instant Book</strong>. Like the name suggests, you can confirm a reservation at these places right away. Learn more about Instant Book.</p>
<h5>Request to Book</h5>
<p>Many hosts prefer to approve reservations before they’re final. In this case, you’ll see a button on their listing that says <strong>Request to Book</strong>. To submit a reservation request, you’ll need to enter your payment details. Hosts have 24 hours to accept your request, and your reservation is automatically confirmed once they do. Learn more about submitting a reservation request.</p>
<h5>Pre-approvals and Special Offers</h5>
<p>If you decide to contact the host to ask questions before attempting to book, the host may respond to your message by inviting you to make a reservation with either a pre-approval or Special Offer. A pre-approval is an invitation to finish booking for the dates and number of guests you noted in your message. A Special Offer gives the host the opportunity to provide special pricing, dates, and other reservation details before you book. Learn more about booking a pre-approval or Special Offer.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<div class="panel">
<h2>How do I contact a host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you want to contact a host before booking a reservation or after a trip, send them a message on Judobnb. Once a trip is confirmed, you can message, email, or call the host to communicate until the trip has ended.</p>
<h4>Before booking a reservation</h4>
<p>If you want to find out more about a listing or host before booking a reservation, you can message the host on Judobnb. Make sure to review the listing page (for example, reviews and amenities) to clarify anything you need from the host.</p>
<p>To send a message:</p>
<ol>
<li>On judobnb.com, go to the listing for the host you want to contact.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Contact Host</strong> on the listing page.</li>
<li>Enter the dates and number of guests for your trip. You can adjust this information before booking.</li>
<li>Write your message and click <strong>Send Message</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>For your safety and privacy, you can’t call or email hosts before your reservation is accepted. Learn more about why it’s good to keep communication and transactions on Judobnb.</p>
<h4>Once a trip is confirmed</h4>
<p>If you have an accepted reservation, you can call or email the host, or message them on the site to communicate about your trip.</p>
<p>You can find the host’s email and phone number in the message thread for your trip, where you can also send the host a message.</p>
<h4>After a trip</h4>
<p>After a trip, you can send a message to your host in your Inbox if you have anything you need to follow up with them about.</p>
<p>If you have any issues that you need to resolve, you can work through payment issues in the Resolution Center on the site.</p>
</div>
<h2>What is a Superhost?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Superhosts are experienced hosts who provide a shining example for other hosts, and extraordinary experiences for their guests.</p>
<p>Once a host reaches Superhost status, a badge will automatically appear on their listing and profile to help you identify them.</p>
<p>We check Superhosts’ activity four times a year, to ensure that the program highlights the people who are most dedicated to providing outstanding hospitality.</p>
<p>The Superhost Terms &amp; Conditions apply. Judobnb doesn&#8217;t endorse or sponsor any host, including Superhosts, or their listings.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can children travel on Judobnb?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>It&#8217;s up to each Judobnb host to decide whether or not to allow infants or children in their space during a reservation.</p>
<h4>Look for Family/Kid Friendly listings</h4>
<p>If a host adds <strong>Family/Kid Friendly</strong> as an amenity, this implies that infants, children, and families are welcome in their listing. You&#8217;ll still need to disclose the total number of guests, including infants and children, accurately when making a reservation request.</p>
<p>You can also ask questions or clarify the details of your trip with your host by clicking <strong>Contact Host</strong> before submitting a reservation request. For example, if your host charges an extra guest fee, you may want to check if the fee applies to infants or children traveling with you.</p>
<h4>You must be 18 or older to create an account</h4>
<p>In order to use the Judobnb site and services, you must be 18 years or older. It&#8217;s against our Terms of Service to create an account to travel or host unless you&#8217;re at least 18 years old.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="panel">
<h2>Can I view a listing before I book?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>We encourage all hosts and guests to complete their bookings through our website before meeting in person to best ensure their safety and privacy.</p>
<p>There are many ways to learn more about the listing and the host without seeing the property, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private messaging</li>
<li>Profile verifications</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Verified photography</li>
</ul>
<p>Hosts also need to provide information about themselves before accepting reservations on the site.</p>
</div>
<h2>What if I can&#8217;t get in touch with my host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you’re having trouble getting in touch with your host after you’ve made a reservation, consider a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most hosts respond within a few hours.</li>
<li>We recommend giving the host a few days to respond. Sometimes things come up or your host might be on a different schedule from you.</li>
<li>Try contacting your host using a different form of communication. For example, you can try reaching them through:
<ul>
<li><strong>Judobnb message</strong>: Find your host in your <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/inbox" target="_blank">Messages</a> and send them a note.</li>
<li><strong>Email or phone</strong>: Go to <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/trips" target="_blank">Your Trips</a>, click <strong>View Itinerary</strong> next to your reservation, and use the email address or phone number listed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your trip is starting or about to start, <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/contact" target="_blank">contact us</a>.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can hosts ask guests to sign a contract?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Yes. Some hosts require guests to sign contracts or rental agreements prior to check-in.</p>
<h4>For hosts</h4>
<p>If you require guests to sign a contract, you must disclose the actual contract terms to them prior to booking. The easiest way to do this is to mention the contract in your listing&#8217;s description, and include the terms in your message thread with the guest.</p>
<p>Judobnb can&#8217;t help enforce any special policies in your contract.</p>
<h4>For guests</h4>
<p>Hosts may ask you to sign a contract, but they must disclose this requirement and its terms prior to booking.</p>
<p>If you’re not comfortable with the contract, you may want to discuss your concerns with the host or look for another place to stay.</p>
<p>If your host asks you to sign a contract that you weren’t notified about before you made the reservation, you can decline to sign the contract and ask your host to cancel your reservation instead.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<h2>Should I book if I have not heard back from the host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Once you’ve found a listing for your trip, we recommend messaging the host to doublecheck the availability of the space for your dates.</p>
<h4>Message the host before requesting</h4>
<p>Unless you have found an Instant Book listing, you’ll have to request that the host accept your stay. It’s a good idea to message the host before requesting, since they can answer questions about their home, as well as let you know it’s available.</p>
<p>To contact a host from the listing page, click <strong>Contact Host</strong> and ask the host any questions you have. Most hosts respond within a few hours. Keep in mind that you may be in different time zones or the host may not have Internet access at the moment.</p>
<h4>The host isn’t responding</h4>
<p>If a host hasn&#8217;t responded, consider reaching out to other hosts in the area. You can message as many hosts as you&#8217;d like, so it&#8217;s up to them to respond to you in a timely fashion or risk losing their chance at having you as a guest.</p>
<h4>Sending multiple requests</h4>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re planning on renting multiple locations for the same dates, make sure you don’t submit more than one reservation request at a time, as you may end up booking multiple reservations during the same time period.</p>
</div>
<h2>How do I view and send messages?</h2>

</ul>
<h2>What does each reservation status mean?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you want to see the status of your reservation, you can find your status in your Inbox on the right side of the message thread with the guest or host.</p>
<p>Once you’ve found your status, you can see the details of the status below.</p>
<h4>Reservation statuses</h4>
<p><strong>Inquiry</strong>: A guest sent a message to a host about certain dates, but hasn&#8217;t submitted a reservation request. In response, the host can send a message, pre-approve, send a Special Offer, or decline the dates of the inquiry.</p>
<p><strong>Reservation Request</strong>: A guest sent a message to a host by submitting a booking request for specific dates. In response, the host will need to either accept or decline the request within 24 hours before it expires.</p>
<p><strong>Pending</strong>: A guest is waiting for a host to respond to a reservation request. The host has 24 hours to respond before the request expires.</p>
<p><strong>Confirmed</strong>: A host accepted a guest&#8217;s reservation request or the request was accepted automatically with Instant Book. Judobnb has collected full payment from the guest and the booking is complete.</p>
<p><strong>Declined</strong>: A host declined a guest&#8217;s reservation request. No charge is made to the guest.</p>
<p><strong>Expired</strong>: A host took more than 24 hours to respond to a pending reservation request. If the host wants to accommodate the expired request, the host will have to send a pre-approval or Special Offer, or the guest will need to send another reservation request.</p>

<h2 class="hide-sm space-8">Instant Book</h2>
<h2>What is Instant Book?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Instant Book listings don&#8217;t require approval from the host before you can book them. Instead, you can just choose your travel dates and discuss check-in plans with the host. There is no additional fee for confirming a reservation with Instant Book. You can filter your search to only view listings that are available through Instant Book.</p>
<p>To be eligible for Instant Book, you must complete your Judobnb account.</p>
<h2>How do I book a place on Judobnb?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>When you book a place on Judobnb, you’re making arrangements to stay in someone’s home. Each host has their own style of hospitality, starting with how they like to get to know their guests. Some hosts want to approve reservations, while others are comfortable letting you book their place instantly without waiting for approval.</p>
<h4>1. Complete Your Profile</h4>
<p>In either case, it’s important to know that Judobnb is a community that relies on trust. Complete your profile before you request a reservation with a host, so they can know a little bit about you when they confirm. Your profile should include photos and verifications, especially because some hosts require guests to have a profile photo or Verified ID in order to book.</p>
<h4>2. Find the Right Place</h4>
<p>With over 800,000 unique listings around the world, you’ll want to make sure the place you choose has everything you need for a comfortable and memorable trip.</p>
<p>When searching for a place, make sure to include your dates and number of guests to get the most accurate pricing. Read reviews, descriptions, house rules, and amenities for each place to see if it’s the right fit for your trip. You can always contact the host if you have any questions about their home.</p>
<h4>3. Book It!</h4>
<p>You’ve found the perfect place, and now it’s time to make it official. This is where the host’s preferred way of booking will determine how you’ll confirm your reservation.</p>
<h5>Instant Book</h5>
<p>For hosts who don’t want to approve each reservation, you’ll see a button on their listing that says <strong>Instant Book</strong>. Like the name suggests, you can confirm a reservation at these places right away. Learn more about Instant Book.</p>
<h5>Request to Book</h5>
<p>Many hosts prefer to approve reservations before they’re final. In this case, you’ll see a button on their listing that says <strong>Request to Book</strong>. To submit a reservation request, you’ll need to enter your payment details. Hosts have 24 hours to accept your request, and your reservation is automatically confirmed once they do. Learn more about submitting a reservation request.</p>
<h5>Pre-approvals and Special Offers</h5>
<p>If you decide to contact the host to ask questions before attempting to book, the host may respond to your message by inviting you to make a reservation with either a pre-approval or Special Offer. A pre-approval is an invitation to finish booking for the dates and number of guests you noted in your message. A Special Offer gives the host the opportunity to provide special pricing, dates, and other reservation details before you book. Learn more about booking a pre-approval or Special Offer.</p>
</div>
<h2>Pre-approvals and Special Offers</h2>
<h2>How do I book a pre-approval or special offer?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you contact a host about their space before requesting to book it, the host has the option to invite you to book a couple of ways:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pre-approval</strong>: The host invites you to book for the dates and prices shown when you contacted the host</li>
<li><strong>Special offer</strong>: The host chooses a custom price (or other details) and invites you to book with the new details</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: A special offer will not include the guest service fee or relevant taxes charged for each reservation.</p>
<h4>Find your pre-approval or special offer</h4>
<p>You&#8217;ll get an email notification when you receive a pre-approval or special offer. You can also check your reservation status by looking in the message thread where you&#8217;re talking with the host.</p>
<h4>Book a pre-approval or special offer</h4>
<p>You won’t automatically be booked when you receive a pre-approval or a special offer. You still need to add your payment details and confirm the reservation.</p>
<ol>
<li>On judobnb.com, go to your Inbox</li>
<li>Click the conversation with the host to open the message thread</li>
<li>Find the box that shows the details of your pre-approval or special offer</li>
<li>Click <strong>Book It!</strong></li>
<li>Add your payment details, and click <strong>Book now</strong></li>
<li>You’ll receive a confirmation email with your itinerary and a billing receipt</li>
</ol>
<p>You have 24 hours to book a pre-approval or special offer before it expires. If 24 hours have passed, you can still accept the pre-approval but your host will have to approve your request before your reservation is confirmed.</p>
<h4>Change your dates</h4>
<p>If you&#8217;ve already been pre-approved or given a special offer, you can still change your dates. On the listing page, click <strong>Contact Host</strong> to send the host a new message and change the dates before sending the message. The host will then have the ability to pre-approve or give a special offer for your new dates.</p>
<h4>The option to book isn’t available</h4>
<p>A host has the ability to pre-approve or extend a special offer to multiple people at once for a set of dates. If someone else booked the space before you, you won’t see the option to accept the reservation.</p>
<h2>What is a pre-approval?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>A pre-approval is a way for host to let guests know that their listing is available when asked about a potential reservation. Once pre-approved, the guest can automatically confirm a booking for the specific dates provided.</p>
<h4>Hosts</h4>
<p>When you pre-approve a guest’s inquiry, you give them permission to automatically confirm a booking for specific dates. The dates won’t be blocked on your calendar, so you can pre-approve multiple guests at one time.</p>
<p>Guests have 24 hours to confirm a booking that has been pre-approved. After 24 hours, the guest can still request to book your listing with the price offered during the pre-approval, unless you remove the pre-approval. You can remove the pre-approval at any time in the message thread.</p>
<h4>Guests</h4>
<p>If a host has sent you a pre-approval, your booking isn’t confirmed until you’ve clicked<strong>Book It</strong> in the message thread with the host and added your payment information. Hosts can send pre-approvals to many potential guests, so if you’ve found the perfect space, make sure to complete the booking process as soon as possible.</p>
<p>You have 24 hours to accept a pre-approval before it expires. If 24 hours have passed, you can still accept the pre-approval but your host will have to approve your request before your reservation is confirmed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Requesting a Reservation</h2>
<h2>How do I submit a reservation request?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you’re ready to book a place on Judobnb, you can send a request to the host to book a reservation. If you’re unsure about the listing or its availability, you can also send a message to the host.</p>
<p>To send a reservation request:</p>
<ol>
<li>On a listing, click <strong>Request to Book</strong>.
<ul>
<li>If you see <strong>Instant Book</strong>, the host is allowing you to book their place instantly. Your reservation will be automatically confirmed after step 4.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Review your reservation details to make sure everything is correct.</li>
<li>Add your payment information, including any coupon code you may have.</li>
<li>Agree to the policies and terms, including the host’s cancellation policy and house rules.</li>
<li>Wait for the host’s response. The host has 24 hours to reply, but most reply within a few hours.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some hosts require that you complete the Verified ID process before confirming a reservation, which allows the host to get more information about who they’re hosting in their home.</p>
<p>If your request is accepted, you’ll be charged in full for the reservation. If the host declines the request or doesn’t respond within 24 hours, no charge is made and you can try booking those dates with someone else.</p>
<h2>When will I be charged?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>You’ll be charged for the total cost of your reservation when it&#8217;s confirmed, which happens as soon as:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve added your payment information</li>
<li>Your host accepts your request (or the request is accepted immediately with Instant Book)</li>
</ul>
<p>Regardless of how far in advance your reservation is booked, we hold the payment for the host until 24 hours after check-in to make sure everything goes smoothly.</p>
<h4>Long term reservations</h4>
<p>For reservations that are 28 nights or longer, you’ll be charged the first month’s payment when the host confirms the reservation. You’ll then be charged a recurring monthly payment during your reservation. In other words, you won&#8217;t make a second payment until one month after you check in.</p>
<h4>Security deposits</h4>
<p>If you make a reservation with a host who asks for a security deposit, you won’t be charged on the deposit unless a host makes a successful claim against the deposit after your trip.</p>
<h2>Should I book if I have not heard back from the host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Once you’ve found a listing for your trip, we recommend messaging the host to doublecheck the availability of the space for your dates.</p>
<h4>Message the host before requesting</h4>
<p>Unless you have found an Instant Book listing, you’ll have to request that the host accept your stay. It’s a good idea to message the host before requesting, since they can answer questions about their home, as well as let you know it’s available.</p>
<p>To contact a host from the listing page, click <strong>Contact Host</strong> and ask the host any questions you have. Most hosts respond within a few hours. Keep in mind that you may be in different time zones or the host may not have Internet access at the moment.</p>
<h4>The host isn’t responding</h4>
<p>If a host hasn&#8217;t responded, consider reaching out to other hosts in the area. You can message as many hosts as you&#8217;d like, so it&#8217;s up to them to respond to you in a timely fashion or risk losing their chance at having you as a guest.</p>
<h4>Sending multiple requests</h4>
<p>Unless you&#8217;re planning on renting multiple locations for the same dates, make sure you don’t submit more than one reservation request at a time, as you may end up booking multiple reservations during the same time period.</p>
<h2>How do I cancel a reservation request?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>As long as your reservation hasn’t been accepted by the host, you can cancel the reservation. You won’t be charged for the reservation or Judobnb service fees.</p>
<p>But, if you cancel after the reservation has been accepted, your reservation will be subject to the terms of the cancellation policy selected by the host.</p>
<p>See how to check the status of a reservation request.</p>
<h4>Cancel a pending reservation request</h4>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Your Trips</strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>On the reservation request you’d like to cancel, click <strong>Cancel Request</strong></li>
</ol>
<h2>How much time does a host have to respond to my reservation request?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts have 24 hours to officially accept or decline reservation requests. You&#8217;ll be updated by email about the status of your request.</p>
<p>More than half of all reservation requests are accepted within one hour of being received. The vast majority of hosts reply within 12 hours.</p>
<p>If a host confirms your request, your payment is processed and collected by Judobnb in full. If a host declines your request or the request expires, we don&#8217;t process your payment.</p>
</div>
<h2>Can I make changes to a pending reservation request?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Yes. If the request hasn’t been accepted by the host, you can cancel the request and send a new one with the updated reservation details.</p>
<h5>To change a reservation request:</h5>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Your Trips</strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Find your reservation request under <strong>Pending Trips</strong></li>
<li>Click <strong>Cancel Request</strong> and then <strong>OK</strong> to confirm</li>
<li>If you want, send a new request with your changed dates or number of guests</li>
</ol>
<h2>How do I check if my reservation is confirmed?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you’ve submitted a reservation request with a host on Judobnb, a couple of things are required to confirm your reservation:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve added your payment information</li>
<li>The host accepts your request (unless you sent a reservation request for a place with Instant Book turned on, which will automatically accept the request)</li>
</ul>
<p>When a host accepts your request, you&#8217;ll receive an email and, depending on your account notification settings, a text (SMS) and push notification from Judobnb. Your reservation request status will also change to <strong>Accepted</strong>.</p>
<h4>Check your reservation status</h4>
<p>To check your reservation status from your computer:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your Trips: Pending and declined reservations show their status, and you can see if a reservation is accepted if you see the option to “Change Reservation”</li>
<li>Your Inbox: Look for the status next to each message thread</li>
</ul>
<p>Read more about what each reservation status means or how to make reservation requests.</p>
</div>
<h2>What happens if my reservation request is declined or expires?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If your reservation request is declined by the host or expires, meaning the host didn’t respond within 24 hours, no charge is made for the reservation and you’re free to book with another host.</p>
<p>We urge our hosts to keep their calendars up to date and respond to requests in a timely manner. But, sometimes situations come up that prevent this from happening.</p>
<p>We recommend messaging several hosts before submitting a reservation request to ask about their availability and ask any other questions you have.</p>
<h4>Temporary authorizations</h4>
<p>Your payment method may be temporarily authorized for a charge when you request a reservation, but this authorization is voided and released back to the payment method if your request is declined or expires. We complete a charge only when a reservation request is confirmed.</p>
</div>
<h2>Do I have to pay if my reservation request isn&#8217;t accepted by the host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No—if your reservation request isn’t accepted by the host or expires without a response, there’s no cost for the reservation or any Judobnb service fees.</p>
<p>Depending on your payment method, you may see a temporary authorization or a refunded charge after a reservation request is declined or expires.</p>
<h4>Temporary authorizations and refunded charges</h4>
<p>Before you submit a reservation request, you&#8217;ll see whether your chosen payment method will place a hold (called an authorization) or charge on your account for the amount of the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>If your payment method is authorized</strong></p>
<p>Some payment methods or locations require that the full amount of the reservation is authorized at the time of your request. If your reservation is accepted, the authorization will turn into a real charge and the amount will be deducted from your payment account.</p>
<p>If the reservation request is declined or expires, you’ll either see the authorization disappear altogether or appear as a refund in your payment account. Depending on the processing time of your bank, the release of the authorization may take up to 7 business days.</p>
<p><strong>If your payment method is charged</strong></p>
<p>Some payment methods or locations require that the full amount of the reservation is charged at the time of your request. If your reservation request is accepted, the charge remains and your reservation is confirmed.</p>
<p>If the reservation request is declined or expires, you’ll be refunded immediately and automatically. Depending on the processing time of your bank, the refund may take up to 10 calendar days to process.</p>
<div class="panel"> </p>
<h2>Can I view a listing before I book?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>We encourage all hosts and guests to complete their bookings through our website before meeting in person to best ensure their safety and privacy.</p>
<p>There are many ways to learn more about the listing and the host without seeing the property, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Private messaging</li>
<li>Profile verifications</li>
<li>Reviews</li>
<li>Verified photography</li>
</ul>
<p>Hosts also need to provide information about themselves before accepting reservations on the site.</p>
<div class="panel"> </p>
<h2>Can I use more than one payment method to pay for a reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No, Judobnb can&#8217;t split your reservation cost across multiple payment methods. To make a reservation, you&#8217;ll need to make your payment with a single payment method.</p>
<p>If you need to update your payment method for a long-term reservation or an unsuccessful charge, please contact us for assistance.</p>
<p>If you have a confirmed reservation that isn&#8217;t long-term, remember that you&#8217;ve already paid in full through our payment system—so you won&#8217;t need to change or update your payment method to enjoy your trip.</p>

<h2>What do I do if my credit card is not working?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Judobnb accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB credit cards, and many debit cards that can be processed as credit. You can try booking with your debit card or contact your bank to ask if your debit card is authorized for online transactions.</p>
<p>If you receive an error message after trying to use your credit card on Judobnb:</p>
<h4>Double-check your payment information</h4>
<p>Be sure that you&#8217;ve entered your credit card number and billing address correctly, your card has enough available funds, and your card has not expired.</p>
<h4>Contact your bank</h4>
<p>Sometimes your credit card may be incorrectly refused by your bank. If you&#8217;ve entered your information correctly and are still having problems using your card, contact your bank or credit card provider to let them know. Inform them of the amount of the charge and the time you tried to make the charge so they can let the transaction go through.</p>
<h4>Try a different credit card</h4>
<p>You can add or use a different credit card to pay for your reservation before submitting your request. Once you&#8217;ve reached the payment page, select <strong>Add new card</strong> in the<strong>Payment type</strong> drop-down menu.</p>
<h4>Try another payment method</h4>
<p>If you continue having issues with your credit card or would prefer to pay a different way, consider using a different payment method.</p>

<h2>Can I book on behalf of a friend or family member?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Transparency and trust are vital to the Judobnb experience. People rely on information in Judobnb profiles, reviews, and other verifications when deciding whether to host or stay with someone.</p>
<p>That’s why we require that Judobnb reservations are booked by the person who&#8217;s going to stay at the listing. For the same reason, you’ll need to be an authorized user of whatever credit card—or other payment method—you use to pay for a reservation.</p>
<p>Instead of making a reservation for someone else, consider referring them to Judobnb. You can refer them to Judobnb directly from your dashboard by clicking the <strong>Invite Friends </strong>button. When a referred friend or family member successfully completes a qualifying reservation, you’ll earn travel credit.</p>

<h2 class="text-copy space-8">Paying</h2>
<h2>Prices &amp; Fees</h2>
<h2>Can I pay with any currency?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No. The currency you pay in is controlled by your country and payment method. It’s not possible to manually choose what currency you&#8217;ll use to pay.</p>
<p>When you select your country and payment method on the checkout page, the currency in which you&#8217;d be charged will be clearly displayed before you confirm your reservation request.</p>
<h4>Exchange rates and currency conversion</h4>
<p>When the currency you’re paying with is different from the host’s listing currency, we convert your payment automatically.</p>
<p>The base exchange rate uses data from one or more third parties, such as OANDA. It’s updated regularly, but may not be identical to the real-time market rate. If you’re viewing the site and paying in your native currency (according to the billing address on your payment method) and that currency differs from the host&#8217;s chosen currency, we also charge a 3% conversion fee, which accounts for holding costs and currency risks.</p>
<p>If your payment includes this 3% conversion fee, we&#8217;ll let you know on the checkout page before you confirm your booking. The conversion fee is separate from and in addition to our guest service fee. The conversion fee is applied to the reservation total after guest service fees have been added.</p>
<h4>Third-party fees</h4>
<p>If you pay in a currency that’s different from the designated currency of your payment method, your provider or third-party payment processor may apply a currency conversion rate or fees to your payment. Contact your provider (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) for information on what fees may apply, since they’re not controlled by Judobnb.</p>
<h4>Currency view</h4>
<p>You can view Judobnb listings in many currencies, but this won’t affect what currency you’ll be asked to pay in. To change your currency view, scroll to the bottom of any page on judobnb.com and click on the currency field to select what currency you want to view listing prices in.</p>
<h2>When do I pay for a reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Your payment information is collected when you submit a reservation request. Once the host accepts your request, or if you book a reservation with Instant Book, your payment method will be charged for the entire amount at that time.</p>
<p>Whether the reservation is two days or two months away, we hold the payment until 24 hours after check-in before giving it to the host. This hold gives both parties time to make sure that everything is as expected.</p>
<h4>Long term reservations</h4>
<p>If you book a reservation for 28 nights or more, you’ll be charged a first month down payment when the reservation is confirmed. Then, the rest of the nights will be charged on a monthly basis.</p>
<h4>Security deposits</h4>
<p>If your listing requires a security deposit, you won’t be charged unless the host files a successful claim within 48 hours of your checkout.</p>
<h2>How is the price determined for my reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>The total price of a reservation on Judobnb is based on a few factors. Note that the price is charged in full once a host accepts your reservation request (or if you use Instant Book).</p>
<p>Costs determined by the host:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Nightly price</strong>: Nightly rate decided by the host</li>
<li><strong>Cleaning fee</strong>: One-time fee charged by some hosts to cover the cost of cleaning their space</li>
<li><strong>Extra guest fees</strong>: One-time fee charged by some hosts to cover other costs related to using their space</li>
</ul>
<p>Costs determined by Judobnb:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Judobnb service fee</strong>: Guest service fee charged for all reservations to help Judobnb run smoothly and offer 24/7 customer support</li>
</ul>
<p>Other costs that may be included:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Currency exchange fee</strong></li>
<li><a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>Value Added Tax (VAT)</strong></a>: Tax charged to guests who live in the European Union, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, and Japan (charged as JCT).</li>
<li><a href="#" target="_blank"><strong>Local taxes</strong></a>—Any taxes charged based on the location of the host&#8217;s listing</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Note</strong>: Security deposits are only charged if the host needs to make a claim.</p>
<h2>When will I be charged?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>You’ll be charged for the total cost of your reservation when it&#8217;s confirmed, which happens as soon as:</p>
<ul>
<li>You’ve added your payment information</li>
<li>Your host accepts your request (or the request is accepted immediately with Instant Book)</li>

<h2>How does Judobnb process payments?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>judobnb’s payment system is designed to make transferring money between guests and hosts as simple and reliable as possible. Here’s how it works:</p>
<ol>
<li>Guests pay Judobnb when they book a place</li>
<li>Judobnb releases the money to hosts 24 hours after the guest checks in</li>
</ol>
<p>Using Judobnb’s payment system is required to make a reservation, and it helps ensure that both parties are protected under our Terms of Service, cancellation policies, Guest Refund Policy, and other safeguards.</p>
<p>Judobnb automatically includes service fees in each transaction, and some government-required taxes where applicable.</p>
<h2>Do I have to pay if my reservation request isn&#8217;t accepted by the host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No—if your reservation request isn’t accepted by the host or expires without a response, there’s no cost for the reservation or any Judobnb service fees.</p>
<p>Depending on your payment method, you may see a temporary authorization or a refunded charge after a reservation request is declined or expires.</p>
<h4>Temporary authorizations and refunded charges</h4>
<p>Before you submit a reservation request, you&#8217;ll see whether your chosen payment method will place a hold (called an authorization) or charge on your account for the amount of the reservation.</p>
<p><strong>If your payment method is authorized</strong></p>
<p>Some payment methods or locations require that the full amount of the reservation is authorized at the time of your request. If your reservation is accepted, the authorization will turn into a real charge and the amount will be deducted from your payment account.</p>
<p>If the reservation request is declined or expires, you’ll either see the authorization disappear altogether or appear as a refund in your payment account. Depending on the processing time of your bank, the release of the authorization may take up to 7 business days.</p>
<p><strong>If your payment method is charged</strong></p>
<p>Some payment methods or locations require that the full amount of the reservation is charged at the time of your request. If your reservation request is accepted, the charge remains and your reservation is confirmed.</p>
<p>If the reservation request is declined or expires, you’ll be refunded immediately and automatically. Depending on the processing time of your bank, the refund may take up to 10 calendar days to process.</p>
<h2>How do I find my trip receipt or itinerary?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Once you have a confirmed reservation, your billing receipt and itinerary are automatically generated and stored in <strong>Your Trips</strong>.</p>
<p>They&#8217;re updated in the event you cancel your reservation, change your reservation, or receive a refund.</p>

<h2>What are guest service fees?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To help cover the costs of running Judobnb, we charge guests a service fee every time a reservation is confirmed. The amount of this service fee varies and is based on a percentage of the reservation subtotal (before fees and taxes).</p>
<p>The exact amount of the service fee is displayed before guests confirm a booking. Service fees for guests typically range between 6-12% but can be higher or lower depending on the specifics of the reservation. The higher the subtotal, the lower the percentage so you can save money when booking large reservations.</p>
<p>We also charge hosts a host service fee to cover the cost of processing payments.</p>
<h4>Find the service fee</h4>
<p>After entering the exact dates and number of guests for a reservation, you’ll see the service fee included as part of the booking details.</p>
<p>The exact amount of the service fee is also located on:</p>
<ul>
<li>The checkout page before submitting a reservation request</li>
<li>Any guest billing receipt</li>
</ul>
<h4>VAT charges on service fees</h4>
<p>Depending on the laws of the jurisdiction involved, VAT may be charged on top of the service fee. The service fee will include these VAT charges when applicable.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> Accommodation fees are charged to the guest directly by the host and may contain local taxes (including VAT).</p>
<h4>Trip cancellations and reservation changes</h4>
<p>See the effect on service fees for the following situations:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a reservation request is retracted, expires or is declined, we don’t charge the guest a service fee</li>
<li>If a guest cancels a reservation, the service fee charged to the guest is non-refundable</li>
<li>If a guest chooses to be refunded after a host cancellation, the service fee charged to the guest is refunded</li>
<li>If a reservation is changed, the service fee charged to the guest adjusts with to the new subtotal</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I pay for my long-term reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you book a long term reservation that lasts 28 nights or more, you’ll be charged a first month down payment and the rest will be collected in monthly installments.</p>
<p>At the moment, you can only pay for a long term reservation on a computer.</p>
<h4>First month down payment</h4>
<p>Once you’ve booked a long term reservation, you’ll be charged for the first month of your stay upfront. We’ll hold this payment until 24 hours after check-in before giving it to the host.</p>
<h4>Payment for future months</h4>
<p>After check-in, we’ll charge you monthly, using the same payment method, for the duration of your reservation. In other words, you won’t make a second payment until approximately one month after you check in. The monthly price you pay is locked at the beginning of the reservation.</p>
<p>You can see your total reservation cost and successful payments made on your billing receipt.</p>
<h4>Cancellation policy</h4>
<p>The Long Term cancellation policy is automatically applied to all long-term reservations of 28 nights or more and requires a 30-day notice of lease termination.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8">
<h2>What are the service fees?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Our system only processes whole numbers, and all fees and totals are rounded to the nearest whole amount.</p>
<h4>Service fees</h4>
<p>Service fees are calculated from the reservation subtotal, excluding any security deposit amount. The subtotal is the complete price of the reservation before service fees have been added. If you change your reservation, the service fees adjust according to the new subtotal.</p>
<h5>Guest service fee</h5>
<p>We add a percentage-based service fee to guest payments every time a reservation is booked. This helps cover the cost of running our site and services.</p>
<p>The exact percentage depends on the subtotal of the reservation. The higher the subtotal, the lower the percentage so you can save money when booking large reservations. You&#8217;ll see the exact amount in the price breakdown on the checkout page before you confirm and pay, and on your billing receipt.</p>
<p>If you cancel a reservation you booked as a guest, the service fee is non-refundable. If your reservation is canceled by the host and you choose to be refunded, the service fee is refunded in full.</p>
<h5>Host service fee</h5>
<p>We deduct a 3% service fee from host payouts every time a reservation is booked at their listing. This helps cover the cost of processing guest payments.</p>
<p>You can see the exact amount by clicking on the reservation code in your Transaction History from the desktop version of Judobnb.</p>
<h4>VAT</h4>
<p>Depending on the country of residence of the host or guest, VAT on the service fees may be included as an additional amount over and above the total Judobnb service fee. Your guest or host service fee includes VAT, when applicable.</p>
<h4>Conversion fee</h4>
<p>An exchange rate that includes a 3% currency conversion fee also applies to guests if they&#8217;re browsing the site and paying in their native currency (according to the payment method&#8217;s billing address) and that currency differs from the host&#8217;s chosen currency.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8"> </p>
<h2>What if a host asks for more money?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>All pricing information is included when you book a reservation using Judobnb. After paying, there are a few situations where you may owe more money.</p>
<h4>Know when to pay more</h4>
<p>You may owe more money if:</p>
<ul>
<li>You change your reservation — for example, you need to add another guest</li>
<li>Your host makes a claim on your security deposit</li>
<li>Your host require taxes to be paid at check-in—this needs to be clearly stated on the listing prior to booking</li>
</ul>
<p>If a host asks you for more money than what you paid on the site and the extra charge wasn’t stated in the listing or in the message thread, you can dispute the charges in the Resolution Center. Never pay a host directly for these charges.</p>
<h4>How to pay after booking the reservation</h4>
<p>If you need to pay the host more money, use the Resolution Center on the site. You should keep all payment transactions on Judobnb because Judobnb can’t help with any issues related to off-site or cash payments.</p>

<h2>Payment Methods</h2>
<h2>What methods of payment does Judobnb accept?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>We support several payment methods, which depend on what country your payment account is located in.</p>
<p>You&#8217;ll see which payment methods are available to you on the checkout page, before you submit a reservation request. After you select your country, all of your payment details will be shown.</p>
<p>Offline or cash payments are a violation of our Terms of Service, and can result in removal from Judobnb. We prohibit off-site payments because paying outside of Judobnb makes it harder for us to protect your information and puts you at a greater risk of fraud and other security issues.</p>
<p>Payment options may include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Major credit cards and pre-paid credit cards (Visa, MasterCard, Amex, Discover, JCB)</li>
<li>Many debit cards that can be processed as credit</li>
<li>PayPal for select countries</li>
<li>Alipay for China only</li>
<li>Postepay for Italy only</li>
<li>Sofort Überweisung for Germany only</li>
<li>iDEAL for the Netherlands only</li>
<li>Boleto Bancário, Hipercard, Elo, and Aura for Brazil only</li>
<li>Google Wallet for US Android App only</li>
<li>Apple Pay for iOS App only</li>
</ul>
<h2>Can I pay with any currency?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No. The currency you pay in is controlled by your country and payment method. It’s not possible to manually choose what currency you&#8217;ll use to pay.</p>
<p>When you select your country and payment method on the checkout page, the currency in which you&#8217;d be charged will be clearly displayed before you confirm your reservation request.</p>
<h4>Exchange rates and currency conversion</h4>
<p>When the currency you’re paying with is different from the host’s listing currency, we convert your payment automatically.</p>
<p>The base exchange rate uses data from one or more third parties, such as OANDA. It’s updated regularly, but may not be identical to the real-time market rate. If you’re viewing the site and paying in your native currency (according to the billing address on your payment method) and that currency differs from the host&#8217;s chosen currency, we also charge a 3% conversion fee, which accounts for holding costs and currency risks.</p>
<p>If your payment includes this 3% conversion fee, we&#8217;ll let you know on the checkout page before you confirm your booking. The conversion fee is separate from and in addition to our guest service fee. The conversion fee is applied to the reservation total after guest service fees have been added.</p>
<h4>Third-party fees</h4>
<p>If you pay in a currency that’s different from the designated currency of your payment method, your provider or third-party payment processor may apply a currency conversion rate or fees to your payment. Contact your provider (for example, your credit or bank card issuer) for information on what fees may apply, since they’re not controlled by Judobnb.</p>
<h4>Currency view</h4>
<p>You can view Judobnb listings in many currencies, but this won’t affect what currency you’ll be asked to pay in. To change your currency view, scroll to the bottom of any page on judobnb.com and click on the currency field to select what currency you want to view listing prices in.</p>
<h2>Can I use more than one payment method to pay for a reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No, Judobnb can&#8217;t split your reservation cost across multiple payment methods. To make a reservation, you&#8217;ll need to make your payment with a single payment method.</p>
<p>If you need to update your payment method for a long-term reservation or an unsuccessful charge, please contact us for assistance.</p>
<p>If you have a confirmed reservation that isn&#8217;t long-term, remember that you&#8217;ve already paid in full through our payment system—so you won&#8217;t need to change or update your payment method to enjoy your trip.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8"> </p>
<h2>How do I remove credit card information from my Judobnb account?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you choose to pay with a credit card when you make a reservation request, you can edit or remove the credit card information later from your Judobnb account, as long as a default payment method remains.</p>
<p>At this time, it&#8217;s only possible to add credit cards from the Payment Methods section of your account, although you can choose to add other types of payment methods on the checkout page when you book.</p>
<h4>Removing or adding a payment method</h4>
<p>To view the credit card information on your Judobnb account:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Account</strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Select <strong>Payment Methods</strong> on the left</li>
</ol>
<p>If you’ve added more than one credit card as a payment method, you’ll be able to remove any card that is not your default payment method by clicking <strong>Remove</strong>. You won’t be able to remove a card that’s currently being used on a pending or active reservation.</p>
<p>To have a card appear first on your list of available payment methods the next time you make a reservation, click <strong>Set Default</strong>.</p>
<p>You can click <strong>Add Payment Method</strong> to add new credit card information to your account at any time.</p>
</div>
<h2>What do I do if my credit card is not working?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Judobnb accepts Visa, MasterCard, American Express, Discover, and JCB credit cards, and many debit cards that can be processed as credit. You can try booking with your debit card or contact your bank to ask if your debit card is authorized for online transactions.</p>
<p>If you receive an error message after trying to use your credit card on Judobnb:</p>
<h4>Double-check your payment information</h4>
<p>Be sure that you&#8217;ve entered your credit card number and billing address correctly, your card has enough available funds, and your card has not expired.</p>
<h4>Contact your bank</h4>
<p>Sometimes your credit card may be incorrectly refused by your bank. If you&#8217;ve entered your information correctly and are still having problems using your card, contact your bank or credit card provider to let them know. Inform them of the amount of the charge and the time you tried to make the charge so they can let the transaction go through.</p>
<h4>Try a different credit card</h4>
<p>You can add or use a different credit card to pay for your reservation before submitting your request. Once you&#8217;ve reached the payment page, select <strong>Add new card</strong> in the <strong>Payment type</strong> drop-down menu.</p>
<h4>Try another payment method</h4>
<p>If you continue having issues with your credit card or would prefer to pay a different way, consider using a different payment method.</p>
<h2>How do I use Alipay to pay?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Alipay is available as a payment method for guests in China who are booking Judobnb reservations less than 28 nights long.</p>
<p>When you submit a reservation request and choose to use Alipay, you&#8217;ll be redirected to the Alipay website. You&#8217;ll need to log in to Alipay to make your payment.</p>
<p>Once your payment for the full amount of the reservation is complete, the reservation request is sent to the host, who will have up to 24 hours to reply.</p>
<p>If your request is accepted, you&#8217;ll be able to access your billing receipt and trip itinerary.</p>
<p>If your request is retracted, declined, or expires, your Alipay account will automatically be refunded in full. Refunds can take up to 3 business days to reflect in your Alipay account.</p>
<h2>How do I use PayPal to pay?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>PayPal is available in select countries for guests booking from the desktop version of Judobnb. Click <b>Request to Book</b> to see what methods are available to you. Payment methods differ depending on the country in which your account is located.</p>
<p>When you submit a reservation request and choose to use PayPal, you&#8217;ll be redirected to the PayPal website. You&#8217;ll need to log in to PayPal to make your payment.</p>

<div class="panel"> </p>
<h2>How do I pay for a reservation with Boleto?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Boleto payment is only available for guests in Brazil, and may not be available to all customers at all times. Additionally, Boleto cannot be used for Instant Book listings, for reservations that are longer than 28 nights, or for reservations that start in fewer than 7 days.</p>
<p>When you submit a reservation request and select Brazil as your country of payment, you’ll see Boleto Bancário as an option in the payment type menu. Choosing this option will present a form that you’ll need to complete with your details.</p>
<p>After the host accepts your reservation, Judobnb will issue a Boleto under your name. You can print it out and pay it through a bank branch, ATM or in a lottery store. Alternatively, you can copy the barcode number and pay via internet banking or through your bank&#8217;s app on your smartphone. We’ll email you a copy of the Boleto so you’ll always have access to it.</p>
<p>After the Boleto is issued to you, you’ll have 24 hours to make the payment, and we’ll confirm it within 96 hours. Your reservation may appear with the status Awaiting Payment for up to 96 hours.</p>
<p>Please keep in mind that this method of payment can take longer if you submit a reservation request on the weekend or within holiday periods.</p>
<p>In case of cancellation, Judobnb will issue a refund and our payment processing partner will send you an email with instructions for how to claim the refund.</p>
<h2>How can I add a guest or business address to my receipt?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">

<h2> Coupons &amp; Credits</h2>
<h2>How do I use a coupon code?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you want to use a coupon on a new Judobnb reservation, you can add it on the same page where you submit payment.</p>
<h4>Find your coupon code</h4>
<p>If you received a coupon from Judobnb, you will find the coupon in your email. At the moment, these coupons don’t automatically show up on judobnb.com.</p>
<h4>Use a coupon on a reservation</h4>
<ol>
<li>On the checkout page for a reservation, click <strong>Coupon code</strong> near your subtotal.</li>
<li>Enter your code.</li>
<li>Click <strong>Apply</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>There are a few things to know about using coupons:</p>
<ul>
<li>Only one coupon can be used for a reservation.</li>
<li>If your coupon has expired, there is no way to re-activate it.</li>
<li>Coupons can only be used once. If you cancel a reservation that used a coupon, the coupon is also no longer valid.</li>
<li>We only accept coupons issued by Judobnb.</li>
<li>If you don’t use the full amount of a coupon, you won’t receive the difference.</li>
<li>Coupons can&#8217;t be applied retroactively.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Use travel credits</h4>
<p>You can receive travel credits for referring people to travel or host on Judobnb. Unlike with coupons, these credits are automatically applied when you book a space.</p>
<p>There are a few things to know about using travel credits:</p>
<ul>
<li>Travel credits can’t be combined with any other coupons.</li>
<li>Travel credits can only be used on qualifying reservations (usually $75 or more, before any guest fees or taxes).</li>
<li>You won’t receive any travel credits until the person you referred has completed a qualifying reservation on Judobnb.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do referrals and travel credits work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Inviting people to Judobnb can earn you—and the people you invite—travel credit to use toward a new reservation.</p>
<h4>Invite friends to use Judobnb</h4>
<p>To begin earning credit, visit the invitation page and send the link to your friends. When a friend clicks the link, they will receive credit that will automatically apply towards their first reservation with Judobnb. The credit will show up automatically on the checkout page of any qualifying reservation.</p>
<p>When your friend completes their first qualifying reservation, you&#8217;ll earn travel credit to use for your own Judobnb reservations. You&#8217;ll receive your travel credit after the departure date of your friend&#8217;s trip.</p>
<p>For each person you refer, there are two opportunities to earn travel credit. You earn credit when your friend completes a qualifying reservation as a guest and also when they complete a qualifying reservation as a host. You can earn up to $5,000 USD in travel credit overall.</p>
<p>To see all of your current referral details, click <strong>Invite Friends</strong> on your Judobnb Dashboard.Terms apply.</p>
<h4>Qualifying reservations</h4>
<p>A qualifying reservation usually has a total value of $100 USD or more, excluding guest fees and any taxes. These amounts may vary during promotional periods.</p>
<h4>Use your travel credit</h4>
<p>Your available travel credits automatically appear as a coupon on the checkout page of your reservation request. If the travel credits aren&#8217;t automatically added, it means the reservation doesn’t qualify.</p>
<p>Travel credits can&#8217;t apply to a trip that has already been paid for, but they will be available and applied to your next qualifying reservation. They expire one year from the date they&#8217;re issued and can only be used once. They’re also not reusable if you cancel a reservation where the credits were applied.</p>
<h2>How do Judobnb gift cards work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Judobnb gift cards are a great way to give the gift of travel! Visit judobnb.com/gift to get started.</p>
<p>If you have a gift card to redeem, click <strong>Redeem a Gift Card</strong> and enter your code. Once a gift card has been added to an Judobnb account, the funds on it will not expire. Gift card balances are visible from your payment methods page. The balance from gift cards will be automatically applied when a trip is booked, but cannot be applied to long-term reservations (28 nights or longer).</p>
<p>To send a digital gift card to anyone in the United States, select <strong>Send a Gift Card</strong>. We’ll send the gift card by email, and the recipient can easily add it to their Judobnb account.</p>
<p>The recipient of a digital gift card has 90 days to claim it and link it to their Judobnb account. If the gift card is not claimed within that time, we&#8217;ll send the gift card balance back to the purchaser on the same payment method they used to pay.</p>
<p>Right now, gift cards can only be purchased in US dollars, but we’ll be expanding on the program in additional currencies in the future.</p>
</div>
<h2>Security Deposits</h2>
<h2>How does Judobnb handle security deposits?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts can add a security deposit to their listing, as long as they add it before a reservation is booked.</p>
<p>If a host wants to make a claim on the security deposit, they must do so within 48 hours of the checkout date. If a claim is made, Judobnb will mediate and collect payment from the guest, as necessary.</p>
<p>Security deposits can&#8217;t be handled off-site in cash, as off-site payments are a violation of our terms.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8"> </p>
<h2>What happens if a host makes a claim on my security deposit?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>When you book a listing with a security deposit, your payment details are stored but not charged or authorized for the deposit unless the host makes a claim. The host has 48 hours from your checkout date to make a claim on the deposit for damages to their property.</p>
<h4>What to expect if a host reports damages</h4>
<p>If your host makes a claim on your security deposit, here’s the process that will be followed:</p>
<ol>
<li>We&#8217;ll ask for documentation from the host, and as soon as we receive it, we&#8217;ll ask them to contact you through Judobnb’s Resolution Center to discuss the claim. If your host sends you a request, you&#8217;ll be notified by email and through an alert on your Dashboard.</li>
<li>Reply to your host&#8217;s request in the Resolution Center within 48 hours. Your response will depend on whether or not you agree to the amount requested by the host:
<ul>
<li><strong>Agree to the amount</strong>: Click <strong>Accept</strong> in the Resolution Center. We&#8217;ll process your payment and send it to your host, which usually takes 5 to 7 business days.</li>
<li><strong>Don&#8217;t agree to the amount</strong>: Click <strong>Involve Judobnb</strong> in the Resolution Center and let us know why you think your host&#8217;s claim is invalid. We&#8217;ll contact you and give you 48 hours to respond to us so we can mediate.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>
<p>In any case, we&#8217;ll make sure you and your host are represented fairly and gather any details and documentation needed to reach a resolution. Most security deposit claims will be resolved within one week.</p>
<h4>Documentation from hosts</h4>
<p>Communication through email is required in order to collect needed documentation from the host, which will include photos and/or video along with receipts, invoices, written estimates, or links to comparable items denoting actual cash value for repair or replacement. If we determine money is owed based on documentation and communication from both parties, we will move forward with collecting from the deposit. We reserve the right to collect payment from you using the payment details we have on file.</p>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8"> </p>
<h2>What is the Resolution Center?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>The Resolution Center lets you request or send money for things related to your Judobnb trip. To open a refund or payment request, go to www.judobnb.com/resolutions.</p>
<h4>Asking for help from Judobnb</h4>
<p>If you’re unable to reach an agreement, you can ask Judobnb to make the final decision 72 hours after the request was opened. To involve Judobnb:</p>
<ol>
<li>Wait 72 hours after you open the request</li>
<li>Go to www.judobnb.com/resolutions</li>
<li>Select the correct reservation</li>
<li>Click <strong>Involve Judobnb</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>When you involve Judobnb, our team will be notified and a dedicated team member will be assigned to your case. They’ll review the information provided by you and your host or guest, before making a final decision. In some cases, we may need to contact you to gather additional information, before we can make a decision.</p>
</div>
<div class="space-4"> </p>
<h2>Can a security deposit be collected outside of the Judobnb website?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>No. To make sure guest payments are protected and to ensure that hosts are properly compensated for reservation damages, we ask that all security deposits be handled through the Judobnb website. Payments outside of the Judobnb website, including security deposits, are a violation of our Terms of Service.</p>

<h2>What if I can&#8217;t get in touch with my host?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you’re having trouble getting in touch with your host after you’ve made a reservation, consider a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Most hosts respond within a few hours.</li>
<li>We recommend giving the host a few days to respond. Sometimes things come up or your host might be on a different schedule from you.</li>
<li>Try contacting your host using a different form of communication. For example, you can try reaching them through:
<ul>
<li><strong>Judobnb message</strong>: Find your host in your Messages and send them a note.</li>
<li><strong>Email or phone</strong>: Go to Your Trips, click <strong>View Itinerary</strong> next to your reservation, and use the email address or phone number listed.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If your trip is starting or about to start, contact us.</li>
</ul>
<h2>How do I share trip details with others?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you want to share your trip plans with the people traveling with you, add them to your reservation, which allows them to see your itinerary.</p>
<ol>
<li>On judobnb.com, go to <strong>Your Trips</strong></li>
<li>Next to the trip you want to share, click <strong>View itinerary</strong></li>
<li>Next to <strong>Guests</strong>, choose <strong>Manage Guests</strong></li>
<li>Add the name and email address of the person coming with you</li>
<li>Click <strong>Send Invites</strong></li>
<li>An email will be sent to the traveler and they can see your full itinerary by signing in (or signing up) for Judobnb</li>
</ol>
<p>If you want to share your itinerary with people not going on your trip, you can add their emails in the message that appears after you’ve confirmed a reservation.</p>

<h2>How can I be a considerate guest?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Traveling with Judobnb provides an opportunity to stay in unique spaces and connect with other members of our community. Like millions of travelers before you, we hope you find that experiencing a destination like a local creates memories, stories, and a feeling of belonging no matter how far you journey from home.</p>
<p>To help you prepare, here are a few tips to help enhance your experience with your listing and your host.</p>
<h4>Before you book</h4>
<ul>
<li>Share your story in the bio section of your profile, and get a Verified ID. Hosts prefer to know who&#8217;s asking to stay with them, and as a result you may have a better chance of your requests being accepted.</li>
<li>Judobnb has a diversity of listings, from shared rooms to entire homes. Make sure the space, house rules, and hosting style match your needs.</li>
<li>Spend some time reviewing your host&#8217;s listing to make sure the place is a good match for you.</li>
<li>Get a sense of the strengths and weaknesses of the listing by reading reviews from other travelers.</li>
<li>Feel free to contact a host with any questions you have about a listing.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Before your trip</h4>
<ul>
<li>Communicate clearly with your host about any expectations or special needs you may have.</li>
<li>Always let your host know if you&#8217;re likely to arrive late for check-in.</li>
</ul>
<h4>On your trip</h4>
<ul>
<li>Honor your commitments (including arrival time) and any house rules.</li>
<li>Enjoy your host&#8217;s home as if you were staying with friends. Be respectful of your neighbors.</li>
<li>Explore the neighborhood and support local businesses. It&#8217;s a great way to feel more like a local. Try asking your host about their favorite neighborhood spots!</li>
<li>Get your host&#8217;s permission before having guests over.</li>
<li>When in doubt, reach out to your host with any questions or problems that arise.</li>
</ul>
<h4>After your trip</h4>
<ul>
<li>Always leave an honest review for your host to help guide future guests. Judobnb is built on community, and your host will also be invited to leave a review for you.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="hide-sm space-8"> </p>
<h2>How does check-in work?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Guests and hosts work out details for checking in, exchanging keys, and checking out directly with each other. There is no online check-in or checkout process.</p>
<p>Read below for some guidelines to help you have a smooth check-in.</p>
<h4>Communication is essential</h4>
<p>Before the start of the reservation, message your host to figure out check-in and checkout times, make plans for the key exchange, and ask any other questions. Keeping communication in your message thread gives you and Judobnb a clear reference if any issues come up.</p>
<p>Also, confirm your contact information and arrival details so you can reach each other in case plans change. Make sure to let each other know if you&#8217;ll be without access to a phone or the Internet.</p>
<h4>Know your reservation details</h4>
<p>After a reservation is confirmed, refer to your itinerary for useful information about your reservation, such as the check-in and checkout time, the listing&#8217;s address, your host&#8217;s contact information, and your billing receipt. If there&#8217;s no check-in or check-out time specified within a listing&#8217;s description, check-in is 3:00 PM local time and checkout is 12:00 PM local time.</p>
<h4>Stay tuned to flight information and weather forecasts</h4>
<p>Look up travel advisories to make sure there is nothing impacting your reservation. With road closures and flight delays, guests and hosts might need a little extra time to safely meet up to exchange keys.</p>
<h4>Key exchange</h4>
<p>Many hosts greet guests in person to exchange keys. Others send keys and instructions in the mail, leave them in a lockbox, or have a neighbor meet a guest. The host can decide whether or not to give a guest a key. But, our Guest Refund Policy states that guests need to have reasonable access to the listing they booked. If you decide not to provide keys, you should mention in your listing’s description and house rules that keys will not be available to the guests so people are aware of the situation before booking.</p>
</div>
<h2 class="hide-sm space-8"> During Your Trip</h2>
<h2>What are house rules?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Hosts share their House Rules to set expectations with their guests, like limits on smoking, areas beyond the listing space that are off-limits, and permission to have visitors.</p>
<p>To add or edit House Rules after you’ve listed your space:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <strong>Manage Listings</strong> on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Click on the listing you want to edit</li>
<li>Hover on the left side of the page to open the menu</li>
<li>Under <strong>Hosting</strong>, click on <strong>Booking</strong></li>
<li>Under <strong>House Rules</strong>, enter your expectations and rules for guests</li>
</ol>
<p>If a guest breaks a house rule, either before or during their stay, you can cancel their reservation without penalty.</p>
<p>House rules appear on your listing page, and guests must review and agree to them before requesting a reservation. They’re also sent directly to a guest once they’ve a confirmed reservation.</p>
<h2>What should I do if something&#8217;s missing or not as expected when I check in?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you notice that something is missing, not working, or otherwise not what you expected when you check in, contact your host right away. Your host is often in the best position to help you—giving them the chance to fix an issue can be the fastest way to make sure you get what you need, and can continue on with your reservation as planned.</p>
<p>In the event that you experience a travel issue, and you and your host aren&#8217;t able to resolve the issue on your own, please take the following required steps within 24 hours of your check-in to make sure you&#8217;re covered by our Guest Refund Policy:</p>
<ul>
<li>Contact us to document the issue and place a hold on the host&#8217;s payment.</li>
<li>Message your host on Judobnb to notify them of the issue. We&#8217;ll need to verify this in your account.</li>
<li>Take photographs to document the situation. It&#8217;s important that your photos show what&#8217;s happening and where (in relation to the rest of the room or space) so we can verify what&#8217;s going on.</li>
</ul>
<p>If your host is unreachable or unresponsive, we&#8217;ll work on issuing you an adequate partial refund if you decide to stay, or a full refund if you decide to leave, as we deem appropriate. You can see a complete explanation of coverage in our Guest Refund Policy.</p>
<p>The Guest Refund Policy doesn&#8217;t apply beyond 24 hours after check-in, but we can always help you mediate with your host if you&#8217;ve tried reaching out with no response.</p>

<h2>Can I change a reservation as a guest?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>If you need to make a change to a confirmed reservation, you can submit a change request to your host.</p>

<h2>Can I get a refund?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>It depends. Refunds for confirmed reservations can be issued for a variety of reasons, but are typically dependant on the cancellation policy a host has selected for their listing.</p>

<li>Extenuating Circumstances</li>
<li>Cases covered by Judobnb’s Guest Refund Policy</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’d like to request a refund from your host for another reason, you’ll need to use Judobnb’s Resolution Center. Our Resolution Center allows you to easily connect with your host, discuss a possible refund, and request mediation from an Judobnb team member if you’re unable to reach an agreement.</p>
<p>Please note that if you are granted a refund, it will take some time to arrive in your account, dependent on your payment method.</p></div>

<div class="space-4">
<h2>Can I make changes to a pending reservation request?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Yes. If the request hasn’t been accepted by the host, you can cancel the request and send a new one with the updated reservation details.</p>
<h5>To change a reservation request:</h5>

<div class="panel"> </div>
</div>
<h2>Can a guest alter or cancel a long-term reservation?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>The Long Term cancellation policy is automatically applied to all long-term reservations of 28 nights or more and requires a 30-day notice for both changes and cancellations.</p>
<h4>Changes to long-term reservations</h4>
<p>If a guest wants to change their reservation, they must submit a change request to the host.</p>
<p>If the guest gives more than 30-days notice, the changes will happen automatically and the guest will be charged or refunded accordingly. If the guest gives less than 30-days notice, or wants to extend their stay, the host will need to accept or decline the changes.</p>
<p>Judobnb service fees are also adjusted if any changes are made to the reservation price.</p>
<h4>Canceling long-term reservations</h4>
<p>If a guest cancels a long-term reservation before the check-in date, the first scheduled payment is paid to the host in full, and the guest is refunded the remaining amount. If the guest cancels during their stay, they&#8217;ll only receive a refund for the nights of the reservation that start 30 days after the cancellation is made.</p>
<h2>What is the Judobnb cancellation policy?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Judobnb allows hosts to choose among three standardized cancellation policies (Flexible, Moderate, and Strict) that we enforce to protect both hosts and guests. A host&#8217;s cancellation policy can be found in the Prices section of their listing page. Guests must agree to the host&#8217;s cancellation policy when they make a reservation.</p>
<p>The Long Term cancellation policy applies to all reservations of 28 nights or more. Each listing and reservation on our site will clearly state the cancellation policy. Guests may cancel and review any penalties by viewing their travel plans and then clicking &#8216;Cancel&#8217; on the appropriate reservation.</p>
<h2>What if a host informs me that the listing I already paid for is now unavailable but they have an alternative?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>Even if you’ve already booked your reservation, it’s your choice whether to accept or decline a host’s offer to book an alternate listing.</p>
<h4>Before paying for a reservation</h4>
<p>If you don’t yet have a confirmed reservation and the host offers you a different listing from the one you discussed, you can book your reservation at this listing or simply look for a new place. You have no obligation to accept the new listing and you should make sure that it would work for your trip before booking.</p>
<h4>After you’ve paid for your reservation</h4>
<p>If your host is asking you to stay in a different listing than you originally booked and you’re okay with a switch, either you or your host can change your reservation. Make sure to check the details of the new listing before accepting a change.</p>
<p>If you’re not okay with a switch or your host is asking you to switch without officially changing the reservation on Judobnb, ask the host to cancel your reservation so you can get a full refund or find another home that better accommodates your stay.</p>
<h4>After you’ve checked in</h4>
<p>If you’ve already checked in and you feel the listing is not what you booked on the site,follow the steps to document the issue and our Guest Refund Policy will make sure you either get the listing you booked or receive a refund.</p>
<h2 class="panel"> Resolve a Problem</h2>

<h4>Asking for help from Judobnb</h4>
<p>If you’re unable to reach an agreement, you can ask Judobnb to make the final decision 72 hours after the request was opened. To involve Judobnb:</p>

They’ll review the information provided by you and your host or guest, before making a final decision. In some cases, we may need to contact you to gather additional information, before we can make a decision.</p>
<h2>What should I do if my host needs to cancel?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<div class="panel">
<div class="panel-body">If your host already canceled your reservation, you can transfer your payment to a new Judobnb reservation or request a refund.</div>
</div>
<p>If your host let you know that they can’t accommodate your stay anymore, don’t cancel for them. If you cancel, you may not be eligible for a full refund depending on the host’scancellation policy.</p>
<p>Instead, send your host a cancellation request to make sure you receive a full refund.</p>

<ol>
<li>Go to Your Trips on judobnb.com</li>
<li>Next to the trip, click <strong>Change Reservation</strong></li>

<li>Click <strong>Send a Cancellation Request</strong></li>
</ol>

If your host accepts the request, or doesn’t respond, you’ll have the option to find a new space for your stay or request a full refund including service fees. If they decline the request, your host is letting you know that they can still host your stay.</p>
<h2>What to do if your host cancels</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>In the event that your reservation is canceled by a host, you have two options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Transfer your payment to a new Judobnb reservation</li>
<li>Get a refund</li>
</ul>

<h2>Standards &amp; Expectations</h2>
<p>To help keep our community safe and trusted, we’ve published <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/standards" target="_blank">Standards and Expectations</a> for all of our hosts and travelers.</p>
<p>We developed these standards based on our extensive experience interacting with members of the Judobnb community. These standards are intended to gather together our existing policies into a single framework that will help members of the Judobnb community better understand what to expect from us and what we expect of them.</p>
<h4>How will the standards be enforced?</h4>
<p>Each enforcement decision is the result of careful and detailed work by a team of experts devoted to ensuring we make the right call. Our responses to violations of these policies have been and will continue to be based on the seriousness of the issue. We will strive to take the circumstances of each situation into account when reaching our enforcement decision, but we have limited discretion in our response to serious violations of the policies.</p>
<h4>What can I do if I disagree with a decision?</h4>
<p>Our enforcement teams are made up of dedicated professionals, but they’re still human. So, in rare cases, enforcement decisions may be incorrect. If you disagree with a decision we’ve made, you can <a href="https://airbnb.com/help/contact_us" target="_blank">contact us</a> and we’ll re-review the decision carefully. The definitions of the standards and expectations themselves aren’t subject to review.</p>
<h4>Will the standards change over time?</h4>
<p>We’re always learning and growing and the standards and expectations will evolve over time. Make sure to review the standards if you have any questions about a particular situation.</p>
<h2>Extenuating Circumstances for Host Cancellations</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>In the rare instance where extenuating circumstances arise, a host may need to cancel a confirmed reservation. In such cases, we may elect to forgo the cancellation penalties outlined in our Terms of Service. Such cases will be contingent on proper documentation, where valid, and include:</p>
<ul>

<h2>Extenuating Circumstances for Guest Cancellations</h2>
<p>In the rare instance where extenuating circumstances arise, a guest may need to cancel a confirmed reservation. In this instance, Judobnb may override the host&#8217;s cancellation policy (flexible, moderate, strict) and make refund decisions. Such cases will be contingent on proper documentation, where valid, and include:</p>
<ul>
<li>There&#8217;s a death in the guest&#8217;s family</li>
<li>The guest has a serious illness or there&#8217;s a serious illness in their family</li>
<li>There&#8217;s a natural disaster in the destination country</li>
<li>There&#8217;s political unrest in the destination country</li>
<li>The guest has jury duty or other similar civil obligations</li>
</ul>
<h2>Guest Refund Policy</h2>
<p>If your host canceled your reservation, you can transfer your payment to a new Judobnb reservation or <a href="#">request a refund</a>.</p>
<p>If you experience a travel issue that prevents you from being able to complete a trip with Judobnb, and you’re unable to <a href="#">resolve with your host</a>, our <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/terms/guest_refund_policy">Guest Refund Policy</a> may be applied in certain circumstances.</p>
<h4>Eligible travel issues</h4>
<p>Situations that may be eligible for a refund under this policy generally fall into one of three categories:</p>
<ul>
<li>The host fails to provide reasonable access to the booked listing.</li>
<li>The listing booked is misrepresented (ex: number of bedrooms, location, lacks promised amenities).</li>
<li>The listing isn&#8217;t generally clean, is unsafe, or there&#8217;s an animal in the listing that wasn&#8217;t disclosed prior to booking.</li>
</ul>
<p>Judobnb will either provide you with a refund or use reasonable efforts to find and book you at another comparable accommodation for any unused nights left in your reservation. The amount of any refund will depend on the nature of the travel Issue suffered.</p>
<h4>Submit a valid claim for refund</h4>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>To submit a valid claim for your reservation, you are required to:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/contact">Contact us</a> within 24 hours of check-in to document the issue and place a hold on the host&#8217;s payment. Include photographs or other evidence of the issue as part of your claim.</li>
<li>Be responsive to our requests for additional information and cooperation.</li>
<li>Not have directly or indirectly caused the Travel Issue.</li>
<li>Have used reasonable efforts to remedy the circumstances of the Travel Issue with the host prior to making a claim, including messaging <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/145/">your host</a> on Judobnb to notify them of the issue. We&#8217;ll verify this in your account.</li>

<h2>What is the Judobnb Host Guarantee?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8"> </p>
<p>The Judobnb Host Guarantee provides protection for up to $1,000,000 to a host for damages to covered property in the rare event of guest damages above the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/140" target="_blank">security deposit</a>or if no security deposit is in place.</p>
<p>The Host Guarantee Program doesn&#8217;t cover cash and securities, collectibles, rare artwork, jewelry, pets or personal liability. We recommend that hosts secure or remove valuables when renting their place. The program also doesn&#8217;t cover loss or damage to property due to wear and tear. For these types of incidents, hosts can add a security deposit in their pricing settings.</p>
<p>The Host Guarantee Program isn&#8217;t insurance and doesn&#8217;t replace your homeowners or renters insurance. Make sure you review and understand the terms of your insurance policy and what it covers and doesn&#8217;t cover. Not all insurance will cover damage or loss to property caused by a guest renting your space. Filing a host guarantee request doesn&#8217;t preclude a guest from financial responsibility for the damages claimed if Judobnb determines a guest was at fault.</p>

<h2>What is Judobnb&#8217;s Anti-Discrimination Policy?</h2>
<p>Judobnb is an open marketplace. Through their experiences on Judobnb, we hope that our guests and hosts build meaningful connections with people from all over the globe.</p>
<p>To that end, we prohibit content that promotes discrimination, bigotry, racism, hatred, harassment or harm against any individual or group, and we require all users to comply with local laws and regulations.</p>
<p>Many countries, including the U.S., have laws preventing discrimination on the basis of race, religion, national origin, disability, sex, sexual orientation, or age. In the U.S., anti-discrimination laws apply to discrimination by any inn, hotel, motel, or other establishment that provides lodging to guests. The two main federal laws in this area are the Fair Housing Act (Title VIII of the Civil Rights Act of 1968) (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA).</p>
<p>The Americans with Disabilities Act prohibits discrimination in public accommodations on the basis of disability, which may include things such as access and service dogs.</p>
<p>In addition, fair housing laws often prohibit discrimination in the selling or renting of such housing based on race, national origin, religion, sex, familial status or disability.</p>
<p>As a host, you should be familiar with the laws that apply to you and your listing.</p>
<p>If you believe a listing or person on the site is in violation of this position, learn how to report it.</p>
<h2>ADA and FHA Compliance Policy</h2>
<p>It&#8217;s important for U.S. hosts to understand their responsibilities under the Fair Housing Act (FHA) and the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). We&#8217;ve included some useful information and resources below.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="#">The Fair Housing Act (FHA)</a></li>
<li><a href="#">The Americans with Disa#bilities Act (ADA)</a></li>
<li><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/898/ada-and-fha-compliance-policy?topic=250#discriminatoryqs">Improper Discriminatory Practices</a></li>
<li><a href="#">Service Animals</a></li>
<li><a href="#">State and Local Laws</a></li>
</ul>
<h3>The Fair Housing Act (FHA)</h3>
<p>The FHA prohibits housing providers from discriminating against applicants or residents because of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, disability, and familial statusincluding children under the age of 18 staying with parents or legal custodians and pregnant womenin most housing related transactions, with a few limited exceptions.</p>
<p>The FHA also makes it unlawful to advertise any preference, limitation, or discrimination based on these categories. One type of disability discrimination prohibited by the FHA is the refusal &#8220;to make reasonable accommodations in rules, policies, practices, or services, when such accommodations may be necessary to afford person(s) [with disabilities] equal opportunity to use and enjoy a dwelling.&#8221;</p>
<p>Additionally, the FHA prohibits housing providers from treating persons less favorably than others because of their disability, refusing residency to persons with disabilities, or placing conditions on their residency, because those persons may require reasonable accommodations, and the FHA requires that new covered multifamily housing be designed and constructed to be accessible. The FHA also prohibits harassment of anyone exercising a fair housing right and retaliation against an individual because he or she has assisted—or participated in any manner—in a fair housing investigation.</p>
<h4>Does the FHA apply to me as a host?</h4>
<p>The FHA does not apply to all hosts. The FHA contains exemptions for owner-occupied buildings with no more than four units, single-family housing rented without the use of a broker if the private individual owner doesn’t own more than three such single-family units at one time, and housing operated by organizations and private clubs that limit occupancy to members and so long as all advertising is nondiscriminatory. There is also a bed-and-breakfast or rooming house exemption for properties &#8220;containing living quarters occupied or intended to be occupied by no more than four families living independently of each other, if the owner actually maintains and occupies one of such living quarters as his or her residence&#8221; which might apply to some hosts&#8217; listings.</p>
<p>The FHA also specifically exempts some senior housing facilities and communities from liability for discrimination based on familial status. To qualify for this exemption, such housing must be intended and operated for occupancy by persons 55 years of age or older or intended for and solely occupied by persons 62 years of age or older. This &#8220;housing for older persons&#8221; exemption does protect against liability for housing discrimination based on race, color, religion, gender, disability or national origin.</p>
<p>However, even if you’re exempt from complying with the FHA, it is still illegal to advertise or make any statement that indicates a limitation or preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex, familial status, or handicap. This prohibition against discriminatory advertising applies to single-family and owner-occupied housing that is otherwise exempt from the FHA. More information can be found at <a href="#" target="_blank">24 C.F.R. pt. 100</a>.</p>
<p>Even if the FHA does not apply to you, we expect our hosts to conduct themselves in a respectful manner and work to bridge differences and make accommodations where possible. Through their experiences on Judobnb, we hope that our guests and hosts build meaningful connections with people from all over the globe.</p>
<h4>Under the FHA, may I exclude people with children?</h4>
<p>If the FHA applies to you, in most instances, you may not exclude children. More information on this exemption can be found at <a href="#" target="_blank">24 C.F.R. pt. 100, subpart E</a>.</p>
<h4><a id="ADA"></a>The Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA)</h4>
<p>The ADA prohibits discrimination on the basis of disability by places of public accommodation and places of public accommodation must comply with basic nondiscrimination requirements that prohibit exclusion, segregation, and unequal treatment. They also must comply with specific requirements related to architectural standards for new and altered buildings; reasonable modifications to policies, practices, and procedures; effective communication with people with hearing, vision, or speech disabilities; and other access requirements. Additionally, public accommodations must remove barriers in existing buildings where it is easy to do so without much difficulty or expense, given the public accommodation&#8217;s resources. To be protected under the ADA, an individual must have a disability or have a relationship or association with an individual with a disability.</p>
<h4>Does the ADA apply to me as a host?</h4>
<p>The ADA does not apply to all hosts. In most cases, the ADA does not apply to residential housing. As a host, you’re subject to the provisions of the ADA if your listing fits its criteria for a &#8220;place of public accommodation.&#8221; Federal regulations (28 C.F.R. § 36.104) define a place of public accommodation to include a place of lodging, except for an establishment located within a facility that contains not more than five rooms for rent or hire and that actually is occupied by the proprietor of the establishment as the residence of the proprietor.</p>
<p>This means that if you are a host renting out five or fewer rooms, the ADA does not likely apply to you. However, you should review the law and additional information regarding the definition of a “place of lodging” at 28 C.F.R. § 36.104.</p>
<p>Even if the ADA does not apply to you, we expect our hosts to conduct themselves in a respectful manner and work to bridge differences and make accommodations where possible. Through their experiences on Judobnb, we hope that our guests and hosts build meaningful connections with people from all over the globe.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="discriminatoryqs"></a>Improper Discriminatory Practices</h3>
<p>Any of the following actions are discriminatory if they are based on a person&#8217;s race, color, religion, sex, handicap, familial status, or national origin:</p>
<ul>
<li>Refusing to rent, or applying more burdensome criteria to certain guests</li>
<li>Misrepresenting the availability of a unit</li>
<li>Discriminating in choosing guests</li>
<li>Limiting the use of common facilities</li>
<li>Failing to provide the same level of service, or adding extra fees or payments</li>
<li>Denying a request for a reasonable accommodation</li>
<li>Threatening, coercing, intimidating or interfering with anyone exercising a fair housing right or assisting others who exercise that right</li>
</ul>
<p>Bear in mind this list is not exhaustive.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="serviceanimals"></a>Service Animals</h3>
<h4>What is a service animal?</h4>
<p>You must accept service animals if the ADA or FHA applies to your listing. A service animal, in short, is a guide dog, signal dog, or other animal individually trained to provide assistance to an individual with a disability. If they meet this definition, animals are considered service animals under the ADA regardless of whether they have been licensed or certified by a state or local government. Some, but not all, service animals wear special collars and harnesses. Some, but not all, are licensed or certified and have identification papers.</p>
<p>Remember that even if the ADA or FHA do not apply to you, there may be additional (broader) state laws that do.</p>
<h4>I have a clear &#8220;no pets&#8221; policy. Do I still have to allow service animals?</h4>
<p>If the ADA or FHA applies to you, yes. A service animal is not a pet. The ADA requires you to modify your no-pets policy to allow the use of a service animal by a person with a disability.</p>
<h4>May I charge a special maintenance or cleaning fee for guests who bring service animals?</h4>
<p>If the ADA or FHA applies to you, no. You may charge guests with disabilities if a service animal causes damage, so long as it is the regular practice to charge non-disabled customers for the same types of damages.</p>
<h4>Am I responsible for the service animal while the person with a disability is my guest? What if the animal is threatening?</h4>
<p>No. The care or supervision of a service animal is solely the responsibility of his or her owner. You’re not required to provide care or food or a special location for the animal. You may exclude any animal, including a service animal, when that animal&#8217;s behavior poses a direct threat to the health or safety of others.</p>
<h4>Do I have to accept guests with service animals even if I am allergic, or animals are prohibited in my building, etc.?</h4>
<p>If you’re covered by the ADA or the FHA, you may be required to accept service animals or assistance animals, no matter your building’s policy or your allergies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><a id="stateandlocallaws"></a>State and Local Laws</h3>
<p>While the FHA and ADAwhich are federal lawsprovide for minimum requirements, you may also be subject to additional and more stringent local laws that prohibit discrimination. Many states and local communities have passed anti-discrimination ordinances and statutes, and renters’ rights vary greatly from state to state. As a host, you should be familiar with the laws that apply to you and your listing(s).</p>

</ul>
<h2>Extortion Policy</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p><a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/13">Reviews</a> are a way for Judobnb guests and hosts to share their experiences with the community. Any attempt to use reviews to force a user to do something they aren’t obligated to do is a misuse of reviews, and we don’t allow it.</p>
<p>This also means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>Guests are not allowed to threaten to use reviews or ratings in an attempt to force a host to provide refunds, additional compensation, or a reciprocal positive review.</li>
<li>Hosts are not allowed to require a guest to leave a positive review or rating, or to revise a review in exchange for a partial or full refund, or reciprocal review. The host also cannot offer a free or discounted stay in exchange for a guest revising an existing review.</li>
<li>If a guest contacts a host with a problem, the host should make every effort to resolve it. The host can&#8217;t ask the guest to take specific actions related to a review in exchange for the resolution of the problem. After the issue is fixed, a host may ask the guest to leave a positive review or rating. A host may also ask a guest to revise a negative review provided certain <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/help/article/13">time constraints</a> are met.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whether you&#8217;re a guest or host, make sure you follow these guidelines. If you don&#8217;t, your account may be restricted, suspended, or terminated. By posting a review, you agree to follow the Judobnb guidelines and policies that Judobnb may enforce at our sole discretion.</p>

<h1>How it Works</h1>
<h2>A Community Built on Sharing</h2>
<p>JudoBNB began in 2008 when two designers who had space to share hosted three travelers looking for a place to stay. Now, millions of hosts and travelers choose to <a href="http://www.judobnb.com/wp-login.php">create a free JudoBNB account</a> so they can list their space and book unique accommodations anywhere in the world</p>
<h2>Profiles</h2>
<p>No two hosts or travelers are the same, so personal JudoBNB profiles help hosts and guests learn more about each other before sharing a space. JudoBNB doesn&#8217;t display full names or contact information on public profiles, so the community can feel confident that their information is safe.</p>
<h2>Listings</h2>
<p>From futons on the floor to castles on the hilltop, each JudoBNB listings is unique. Search results feature entire homes, private rooms, and shared rooms at every price point. Hosts describe their space in detail, including available amenities and arrival and departure times, and guests leave reviews about their experience.</p>
<h2>Host Groups and Community Meetups</h2>
<p>JudoBNB helps its community stay connected through online forums and real-life meetups. JudoBNB Groups gives hosts an online space to come together to share stories, insights, and advice. Both hosts and guests use <a href="#">JudoBNB Meetups</a> to find like-minded locals and travelers in every corner of the world.</p>
<h2>Trusted Services</h2>
<p>JudoBNB helps make sharing easy, enjoyable, and safe. We verify personal profiles and listings, maintain a smart messaging system so hosts and guests can communicate with certainty, and manage a trusted platform to collect and transfer payments.</p>
<h2>Verifications</h2>
<p>JudoBNB puts hosts and travelers at ease with features like <a href="#">Verified ID</a> and public reviews. Having a Verified ID indicates that you&#8217;ve completed a specific set of verifications—offline ID, online ID, profile photo, email address, and phone number. Hosts and guests also build trust and cultivate their reputations by writing reviews about their experiences after each trip.</p>
<h2>Messaging</h2>
<p>Our messaging system ensures that communication between hosts and guests stays on JudoBNB so your contact information remains private until you have a confirmed reservation. For your peace of mind, we&#8217;ve added reporting features so you can easily notify us if you ever feel uncomfortable.</p>
<h2>Payment System</h2>
<p>Our convenient payment system supports many currencies and several types of payment and payout methods. JudoBNB collects guest payments from the moment they make a reservation and waits until 24 hours after arrival before releasing funds to the host. This way, guests and hosts can feel confident knowing that Judobnb will process and deliver payments when a reservation is honored.</p>
<h2>24/7 Customer Support</h2>
<p>Whether you’re traveling or hosting, we’re here for you before, during, and after your experience. We&#8217;ve answered the most common questions about JudoBNB in our Help Center, and for everything else you can contact us by visiting judobnb.com/contact. </p>
<h1>How to Travel</h1>
<h2>Search</h2>
<p>JudoBNB hosts share their spaces in 190 countries and more than 34,000 cities. All you have to do is enter your destination and travel dates into the search bar to discover distinctive places to stay, anywhere in the world. Learn More</p>
<h2>Tools that help you search</h2>
<p>We display photos of listings, host profiles, and reviews to help you make informed decisions when considering a host&#8217;s space. We&#8217;ve also created search filters so you can narrow your results by type of accommodation, price, and location. For example, if you’re looking to make friends and stay with a host, select Private Room or Shared Room. Or if you’re looking for an entire space to call your own, go ahead and select the Entire Place filter.</p>
<h2>Contacting hosts to book a stay</h2>
<p>Once you complete your profile to give hosts a good idea of the kind of guest you are, you can request to book a host&#8217;s space by clicking the Contact Host or Request to Book buttons, or you can use <a href="#">Instant Book</a> to confirm your stay without having to wait for a host&#8217;s approval.</p>
<h2>Book</h2>
<p>There are a few ways to book spaces on JudoBNB. Some hosts want to get to know a guest before they confirm a reservation while others prefer to reduce the time it takes to manage requests by using JudoBNB&#8217;s Instant Book feature. Learn More</p>
<h2>Buttons to book a stay on JudoBNB</h2>
<p>The <strong>Request to Book</strong> button sends a reservation request to a host for the specific trip dates you select. The host has the option to either accept or decline the request, or ask you questions about your trip. When a host responds to your request, we send you an email to let you know. If they don&#8217;t respond within 24 hours, your request simply expires.</p>
<p>The <strong>Instant Book</strong> button immediately confirms your reservation and closes the host&#8217;s calendar to other incoming requests. We send you a receipt by email with your trip&#8217;s details, and your host may follow up with you, too.</p>
<p>The <strong>Contact Host</strong> button lets you start a conversation about their space and hosting style through our secure messaging system. You can use our messaging system to discuss trip details, request special prices, or ask about specific amenities.</p>
<h2>Payment and confirmation</h2>
<p>Whether you use the <strong>Request to Book</strong> button or the Instant Book button, we&#8217;ll ask for your payment details so we can hold your reservation.</p>
<p>If you use the <strong>Request to Book</strong> button to send a request, the host has 24 hours to respond. We won&#8217;t charge your payment method until the host accepts your reservation. Once the host accepts, we process your payment and send you a congratulatory email that includes your receipt, trip details, and best wishes for a great trip. If you don&#8217;t hear back within 24 hours, your request automatically expires.</p>
<p>If you use the <strong>Instant Book</strong> button, your reservation will be immediately confirmed and we&#8217;ll process your payment right away.</p>
<h2>Travel</h2>
<p>Once you know where you’re traveling and whose space you&#8217;ll be staying in, all you have to do is get going! Learn More</p>
<h2>Before you get there</h2>
<p>Send a message to your host to arrange a check-in time and arrival details like picking up the key. Then download the JudoBNB app so you can stay in the know while on the go. We&#8217;ll send you an email that includes your trip itinerary, receipt, and host contact information. You can also view your reservation details, alter your plans, or cancel your reservation from the My Trips section on your personal account page.</p>
<h2>During your trip</h2>
<p>We encourage you to have the time of your life! Enjoy your host&#8217;s home and city as if it were a friend&#8217;s, and remember to be considerate of your neighbors. If any issues arise during your trip, be sure to get in touch with your host. In most cases, they&#8217;ll be the person best equipped to help you. If your host can&#8217;t solve the problem, please contact us.</p>
<h2>After you travel</h2>
<p>Write a review about your host and their space so other travelers can learn through your experience. Your host will also have a chance to write a review for you, too. Then, pick the next place you&#8217;d love to go and find a space on JudoBNB!</p>
<h1>How to Host</h1>
<h2>List Your Space</h2>
<p>We encourage you to share all kinds of spaces on JudoBNB! Whether you’re offering a seaside villa or an air mattress in the corner of your living room, it’s free to <a href="#">list your space</a>. When you’re ready to start welcoming guests, you can publish your listing for the world to see. Learn More</p>
<h2>Description and amenities</h2>
<p>Guests often search for spaces that meet specific needs, so accurately describing your listing and the amenities you offer will help attract the kinds of guests that are best for you. When telling the story of your space, answer important questions like whether or not you have Wifi, and include helpful details about the character, activities, and transportation options in the surrounding area.</p>
<h2>Photos</h2>
<p>Photographs help guests picture themselves in your space. Go ahead and upload up to 24 images, and make sure your photos are well lit, in focus, and representative of the actual space your guests have access to.</p>
<p>We love lush imagery, so we offer free professional photography to active hosts in most areas. <a href="#">Apply online</a> and we&#8217;ll send a professional photographer to capture your listing in its best light.</p>
<h2>Pricing and availability</h2>
<p>You know your space and your schedule best, so we let you decide the price and we ask you to update your calendar to reflect when it’s available to rent. We also allow you to set custom prices for individual nights and weekends, special events, and monthly stays. We display your listing at the price you set and when you indicate that your space is unavailable, we make sure not to show it in search results.</p>
<h2>Respond to Requests</h2>
<p>Guests who love your space will want to book it! On JudoBNB, you have the option to require guests to send a reservation request or allow certain guests to book your space instantly through Instant Book. </p>
<h2>Manage your calendar</h2>
<p>Edit your calendar settings to control when and for how long guests can book your space.</p>
<h2>Simplify with Instant Book</h2>
<p>If you prefer to set criteria to allow certain guests to book your space without having to wait for your approval, you can choose to use our Instant Book feature.</p>
<h2>Welcome Your Guests</h2>
<p>Once you have a confirmed reservation, it’s time to prepare for your guests! From tidying your space and coordinating key exchange to greeting your guests and giving them neighborhood tips, hosting on JudoBNB is an artform.</p>
<h2>Preparing your space</h2>
<p>Give your guests a clean space to come home to and make sure they have everything they&#8217;ll need for a comfortable stay, whether it’s an extra set of towels, cream and sugar for coffee, maps to find their way, or instructions for how to access the internet. If you like, you can make their stay extra special by surprising them with a bottle of wine or hand-written welcome note. To learn more about what it means to be a host, visit our <a href="#">Hospitality Standards</a></p>
<h2>Coordinating arrival and departure</h2>
<p>Use our messaging system to arrange the details of your guest’s arrival and departure. Let your guest know if you’ll greet them in person or tell them where they can find your key.</p>
<h2>Being available during your guest’s stay</h2>
<p>During reservations, be available to help remedy any issues that may arise. If you&#8217;ll be out of the area, provide your guests with a designated and reliable point of contact.</p>
<h2>Writing reviews</h2>
<p>Genuine reviews are the cornerstone of JudoBNB&#8217;s trusted community. You have 14 days to write a review and share comments about your experience with your guest. Your guest also has the opportunity to review you and your space, too!</p>

<h2>How do reviews work?</h2>
<p>All the reviews on Judobnb are written by hosts and travelers from our community, so any review you see is based on a stay that a guest had in a host&#8217;s listing.</p>
<h4>Writing a review</h4>
<p>To leave a review for a recent trip, go to your <strong>Reviews</strong>. Reviews are limited to 500 words and must follow Judobnb&#8217;s review guidelines. You can edit your review for up to 48 hours, or until your host or guest completes their review.</p>

<h3>Host Guarantee &amp; Host Protection Insurance</h3>
<h2>What is the Judobnb Host Guarantee?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<p>The Airbnb Host Guarantee provides protection for up to $1,000,000 to a host for damages to covered property in the rare event of guest damages above the security deposit—or if no security deposit is in place.</p>
<p>The Host Guarantee Program doesn&#8217;t cover cash and securities, collectibles, rare artwork, jewelry, pets or personal liability. We recommend that hosts secure or remove valuables when renting their place. The program also doesn&#8217;t cover loss or damage to property due to wear and tear. For these types of incidents, hosts can add a security deposit in their pricing settings.</p>
<p>The Host Guarantee Program isn&#8217;t insurance and doesn&#8217;t replace your homeowners or renters insurance. Make sure you review and understand the terms of your insurance policy and what it covers and doesn&#8217;t cover. Not all insurance will cover damage or loss to property caused by a guest renting your space. Filing a host guarantee request doesn&#8217;t preclude a guest from financial responsibility for the damages claimed if Airbnb determines a guest was at fault.</p>
<p>Learn more about the Host Guarantee at: www.judobnb.com/guarantee.</p>
<p>View the Host Guarantee terms and conditions at:www.judobnb.com/terms/host_guarantee. If you can&#8217;t view this page, the country you&#8217;re accessing Judobnb from doesn&#8217;t have Host Guarantee coverage right now.</p>

<h2>How do taxes work for hosts?</h2>
<div class="text-copy space-8">
<h5>Local Tax</h5>
<p>If you determine that you need to collect tax, you can usually either incorporate it into your nightly price, add it within a Special Offer, or ask your guests to pay it in person. In each case, it&#8217;s important that guests are informed of the exact tax amount prior to booking. If you choose to collect tax outside of your listing&#8217;s rates, please note that it should be collected only upon arrival and that we are unable to assist with collection.</p>
<p>In some locations, Judobnb hosts may have a collect and remit feature available to handle occupancy tax. Hosts should not collect occupancy taxes separately for those jurisdictions.</p>
<p>Learn more about Local Tax.</p>
<h5>Value Added Tax</h5>
<p>If your country of residence is part of the European Union, you may need to assess Value Added Tax (VAT) on the services you provide. We encourage you to consult a tax advisor in your area for more insight or if you need assistance assessing VAT on the services you provide.</p>
<p>Additionally, Judobnb is required to collect VAT or JCT on its service fees in countries that tax Electronically Supplied Services. Currently, that includes all countries in the EU, Switzerland, Norway, Iceland, South Africa, and Japan.</p>
<p>Learn more about Value Added Tax.</p>
<h5>US Income Taxes</h5>
<p>As a host, your earnings may be subject to US income taxes. To assist with US tax compliance, we may collect your taxpayer information. Even if you&#8217;re not a US taxpayer, we may still require certain information from you.</p>
<p>To add new taxpayer information, go to your Payout Preferences and complete the appropriate form.</p>
<div>
<p><strong>US persons</strong> (including domestic corporations) may fill out a Form W-9. At the end of January, we will provide hosts who&#8217;ve earned over $20,000 and had 200+ reservations with a Form 1099-K showing their reportable earnings from the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Non-US persons who have a US Taxpayer Identification Number</strong> (either a Social Security Number or Employer Identification Number) may fill out a Form W-8ECI. We&#8217;ll provide hosts who submit a W-8ECI with a Form 1042-S showing any US sourced earnings from the previous year.</p>
<p><strong>Non-US persons who do not have a US Taxpayer Identification Number</strong> may fill out a Form W-8BEN to certify their foreign status. Judobnb is required to withhold 30% on all payouts from US listings hosted by non-US persons unless valid tax treaty benefits have been claimed. We&#8217;ll provide hosts who have submitted a W-8BEN with a Form 1042-S showing any US sourced earnings from the previous year.</p>
</div>
<p>You can learn more about how the IRS classifies taxpayers for US tax purposes at irs.gov. If you&#8217;re unsure of which form to submit, we encourage you to consult a tax professional who can clarify your tax status. If you&#8217;ve received a request to submit your taxpayer information and haven&#8217;t provided it yet, we may be required to withhold a percentage of your earnings.</p>
<p>We expect all hosts to comply with the tax regulations in their area.</p>

<li>Direct messaging: Want to ask another host a private question? You can now direct message other community members right from the Community Center.</li>
<li>Meetups: Meetups are a great way to meet other hosts, share best practices, and get advice from people like you. Over 12,000 meetups have been organized by hosts in 85 cities around the world.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Available languages</h4>
<p>The Community Center is available in English, French, Italian, German, Spanish, Brazilian Portuguese, Korean, Dutch, and Japanese. We plan to offer support more languages soon.</p>
<h4>Cities</h4>
<p>Cities boards are location-specific boards you can use to connect with other hosts in your area. You can view any Cities board to connect with hosts in that area.</p>
<p>Don’t see your city yet? Use the <strong>Where in the world?</strong> board to start a location-specific conversation. You can use tags to help other community members find your post.</p>
<h4>Managing the Community Center</h4>
<p>This is your community. You own the discussions, and the Community Center will ultimately rely heavily on your level of engagement.</p>
<p>The Community Center will be largely self-moderated, but you may also see a faces from the Judobnb team around from time to time to to share updates, answer tricky questions, and help keep things clean and safe.</p>
