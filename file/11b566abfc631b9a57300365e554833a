<p>Certain things in life can seem&nbsp;like a struggle.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>That's true whether you are a <strong>private individual</strong> looking to pursue a personal injury claim or are wanting the support of a conveyancing solicitor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>It's equally true if you are a <strong>solicitor looking for PII quotes</strong>, considering Fee Sharing, are looking to buy or sell a practice or are simply searching for a safe pair of hands to handle your Property searches. &nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Taking the house moving scenario as an example it's a difficult process to go through and it helps if&nbsp;the firm of conveyancing solicitors you're dealing with&nbsp;are on top of their game. ie. not overloaded with work to the point where &quot;service&quot; becomes an issue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In situations like these we help out in the event there's a problem with your conveyancing. ie. we get involved and knock heads together... As Legal Brokers we're here to help you&nbsp;every step of the way.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><a href="conveyancing/index.htm"><strong>Please click here if you need a Conveyancing&nbsp;quote.</strong></a></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As such the different <span style="color: rgb(51,51,51)">conveyancing</span> firms and solicitors we recommend have proven themselves by both their efforts and their understanding. Plus we like to work with nice people, too, and that generally helps.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If, in the first instance, you would like an informal chat about any legal&nbsp;issue such as&nbsp;Wills,&nbsp;individual Conveyancing Solicitors (EPC's if you're selling a home),&nbsp;Personal Injury&nbsp;or a PPI claim&nbsp;please don't hesitate to call our helpline on <span style="color: rgb(255,0,0)"><strong>0845 603 0708.</strong></span>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a seperate&nbsp;note if you're a friendly solicitor, and you're comfortable working to fixed fees, please contact us&nbsp;and we'll&nbsp;discuss membership of our panel,&nbsp;our search requirements, and how we can help you.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>.... and finally if you'd like to discuss advertising on <a href="http://www.nationalsolicitors.com">www.NationalSolicitors.com</a>, or buying &amp; selling a law firm, fee sharing, obtaining PII quotes or legal franchise opportunities please&nbsp;grab a phone and call right now.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<div class="element2">
<h3>Conveyancing Solicitors</h3>
<p>Why do we work with Conveyancing Solicitors rather than Licensed Conveyancers ? There's no particular reason other than the fact that we prefer to deal with solicitors because of their general knowledge and understanding of the law. It's not always the case but generally Conveyancing Solicitors tend to be better funded and have Case Management software and Online Tracking facilities. The legal profession can be a mine field and whilst, admittedly, solicitors can be slightly &quot;stuffy&quot; as long as you select the right Conveyancing Solicitors your transaction should run very smoothly. Plus if there's a problem we're here to help!</p>
<h3><br>
Conveyancing</h3>
<p>The fact of the matter is that conveyancing is a complicated procedure but it's not rocket science. In the first instance the solicitor's name has to be passed over to the Estate Agent and they then generate the Memorandum Of Sale. This piece of paper is sent to both solicitors &amp; they then write to each other to begin the process in earnest. Contracts are then sent out and the fundamentals of the conveyancing transaction begins. There are various procedures to go through, on a step by step basis, that subsequently take a prospective client from placing an offer to actual Completion of the conveyancing process. It isn't easy and, especially for Leasehold transactions, there can be complications along the way but we're here to help. We'll contact the solicitor, on your behalf, if there's a problem and try to resolve any problems as they occur. Conveyancing is our business and we'll help when needed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><br>
<span style="font-size: medium;"><strong>Property Solicitors</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you're looking for property solicitors who can provide a service that covers both England and Wales we can offer you the services of four specialist conveyancers. The UK market is filled with thousands of firms who can carry out traditional domestic conveyancing but we find it makes more sense to use firms who are either specialist property solicitors or, alternatively, are large Practices who have dedicated conveyancing departments. The benefits of this approach are such that the individual staff are 100% devoted to the task at hand and can competently deal with all aspects of the legal work without being dragged into other areas. Using the &quot;dedicated&quot; approach the property solicitors are more likely to use invaluable tools such as Case Management software and Online Case Tracking. All solicitors are not the same and it pays to deal with those specialist property solicitors who have already been approved by ourselves.</p>
<h3><br>
<span style="font-size: medium">Solicitors Fees</span></h3>
<p>Trying to establish the exact solicitors fees you're being charged isn't always easy &ndash; generally speaking it can be a nightmare. Because solicitors will sometimes go out of their way to confuse the issue we have established the disbursements necessary for each transaction and we state them clearly on the website. In this way you can be assured that there are no hidden solicitors fees or additional extra's which you'll subsequently be charged. You may find it useful, when comparing quotes, to use our figures as a template. With this in mind you'll find that the solicitors fees you'll see on our site are both a genuine and reliable guide to the cost of your conveyancing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: medium"><strong>Legal Franchise Opportunities</strong></span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-size: small">As part of&nbsp;</span>our growth plan we're looking to work with proactive individuals who are interested in a searches or legal services franchise. We specialise in, amongst others,&nbsp;local authority, personal, drainage, enviro &amp; coal&nbsp;searches. If your currently involved in the Legal profession and are looking to spread your wings by developing your own legal franchise and are looking for opportunities we're ideally placed to help.
