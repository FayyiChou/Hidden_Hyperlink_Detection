		I love technology and started developing code at the age of 13. Starting off with simple programs, I developed my knowledge ensuring I understood all the concepts clearly. I now program daily and get involved in hackathons to test my abilities.
	</p> </br>
	<p>
		One of my most recent projects includes an app for the GP Surgery. The NHS is crumbling and in my desperate hopes to keep it afloat, I invented an app that allows users to get their symptoms checked, order and track their medication and then book their appointments online. This greatly reduces the stress on the surgery but needed a good User Interface (UI) to be accessible for everyone. To innovate a new and useful UI, I worked hard to focus on the end user's perspective. I used a simple responsive design, easy to understand layout and ensured that tasks could be completed quickly and easily.

		To show my new app to the public, I went to see the Great Ormand Street Directors, they loved the idea and directed me towards Egton Medical Information Systems who now incorporated my UI.
