We took our time and time to talk to people at all the places we visited. The weather was perfect as we did not experience a drop of rain .<br />Paul was great and very professional as he brought us our bikes to our hotel and collected them back at our destination. The bikes were great and in very good condition.<br />This is the vacation my son and I will remember all our life and waiting to discover other region<br />of beautiful UK.</p><p><span data-scayt_word="Rishmein" data-scaytid="58">Rishmein</span> kindly sent us photographs of his trip which are dotted throughout the <span data-scayt_word="website" data-scaytid="61">website</span>, as did <span data-scayt_word="Pascale" data-scaytid="59">Pascale</span> and Alain and many other cyclists.&nbsp; Please keep them coming!<br />&nbsp;</p><p><br /><strong>Our Facebook competition to win bike hire</strong> for two delivered to your holiday accommodation in Cornwall has been launched!
