        <p> This work reports the in vitro antioxidant and anti-inflammatory activities and toxicity of infusions and decoctions of Limonium algarvense flowers, and green tea. The total contents in different phenolic groups and the quantification of individual phenolics by HPLC are also reported. L. algarvense and green tea had similar antioxidant properties, except for hydroxyl radical-scavenging activity, higher on green tea, and iron chelating potential, higher on L. algarvense. The later species also had the uppermost anti-inflammatory potential. Green tea decoction had the highest content of phenolic groups, but the infusion of L. algarvense had higher amounts of salicylic, gallic and coumaric acids. L. algarvense was not toxic, whereas green tea was toxic for S17 cells. Under our experimental conditions, infusions and decoctions of L. algarvense flowers had similar or higher antioxidant and anti-inflammatory properties than green tea, and thus, may be useful for alleviating symptoms associated with oxidative and inflammatory-related diseases. <br /><br /></p>

      <div class="art_content"> 
       <div> 
        <p> The objective was to elucidate the influence of NaCl and polyphosphates in the stage of protein swelling on the water-holding capacity (WHC) of meat batter. The meat batters were formulated with salt in different ways by adding established amounts of only NaCl, only polyphosphates, jointly adding NaCl and polyphosphates, and a control without any salt. An increase (p &amp;lt;0.05) in water retention was found when a combination of NaCl and polyphosphates was used. A high textural parameter was observed in the two treatments with NaCl, but not in the group with only polyphosphate. For the polyphosphate group, T 22 was lower (p &amp;lt;0.05) than in the other three before heating; however, after heating, T 21 and T 22 were both significantly decreased, and a new component emerged, T 23, which was significantly lower than the others. For the NaCl treatment, heated or not, T 22 was always the highest. It was revealed that NaCl had affected the WHC by increasing the mobility and distribution of water, particularly with polyphosphate, but polyphosphate could not be an equal substitute for NaCl given its resulting lowest textural properties and poor microstructure. By presenting different hydration states in the protein swelling stage, the meat batter qualities were differentiated. <br /><br /></p>

      <div class="art_content"> 
       <div> 
        <p> Flavour stability is vital to the brewing industry as beer is often stored for an extended time under variable conditions. Developing an accelerated model to evaluate brewing techniques that affect flavour stability is an important area of research. Here, we performed metabolomics on non-volatile compounds in beer stored at 37&deg;C between 1 and 14days for two beer types: an amber ale and an India pale ale. The experiment determined high temperature to influence non-volatile metabolites, including the purine 5-methylthioadenosine (5-MTA). In a second experiment, three brewing techniques were evaluated for improved flavour stability: use of antioxidant crowns, chelation of pro-oxidants, and varying plant content in hops. Sensory analysis determined the hop method was associated with improved flavour stability, and this was consistent with reduced 5-MTA at both regular and high temperature storage. Future studies are warranted to understand the influence of 5-MTA on flavour and aging within different beer types. <br /><br /></p>

      <div class="art_content"> 
       <div> 
        <p> The purpose of this study was to verify the reliability of photostimulated luminescence (PSL) and thermoluminescence (TL) methods for identifying irradiated foods, described in the European standards EN 13751:2002 and EN 1788:2001, respectively, which were established solely through interlaboratory studies on gamma-irradiated food. Red pepper powder samples irradiated with electron-beams (e-beams), gamma rays and high-energy X-rays were used as model foods. Samples irradiated with each radiation type at 824kGy could be correctly identified by the PSL method, whereas samples irradiated at 820.5kGy with each radiation type could be correctly recognized by the TL method when e-beams, gamma rays, or high-energy X-rays were used as normalization sources. However, different TL intensities were observed for minerals separated from red pepper powder for different irradiation sources, which was confirmed using pure quartz and K-feldspar minerals. Further interlaboratory studies are required to verify this phenomenon. <br /><br /></p>

      <div class="art_content">

        <p> A lectin (HFL) was isolated from the brown alga, Hizikia fusiformis, through ion exchange on cellulose DE52 and HPLC with a TSK-gel G4000PWXL column. SDS¨CPAGE showed that HFL had a molecular mass of 16.1kDa. The HPLC (with a TSK-gel G4000PWXL column) indicated that HFL is a tetramer in its native state. The total carbohydrate content was 41%. Glucose, galactose and fucose were the monosaccharide units of HFL, and the normalized mol% values were 6, 14 and 80, respectively. HFL contains a large amount of the acidic amino acid, Asx. The ¦Â-elimination reaction suggested that the oligosaccharide and peptide moieties of HFL may belong to the N-glucosidic linkage. The amino acid sequences, of about five segments of HFL, were acquired by MALDI-TOF/TOF, and the sequences have no homology with other lectins. HFL was found to agglutinate sheep erythrocytes. The hemagglutination activity was inhibited by thyroglobulin, from bovine thyroid, but not by any of the monosaccharides tested. The lectin reaction was independent of the presence of the divalent cation Ca2+. HFL showed free radical scavenging activity against hydroxyl, DPPH and ABTS+ radicals. <br /><br /></p>

      <div class="art_content"> 
       <div> 
        <p> The recent development of fused-core technology in HPLC columns is enabling faster and highly efficient separations. This technology was evaluated for the development of a fast method for the analysis of main curcuminoids (curcumin, demethoxycurcumin and bisdemethoxycurcumin) present in extracts of turmeric (Curcuma longa L.). A step-by-step strategy was used to optimize temperature (40¨C55&deg;C), flow rate (1.0¨C2.5mLmin6Ó11), mobile phase composition and equilibration time (1¨C5min). A gradient method was developed using acidified water and acetonitrile combined with high column temperature (55&deg;C) and flow rate (2.5mLmin6Ó11). Optimized conditions provided a method for the separation of these three curcuminoids in approximately 1.3min with a total analysis time (sample-to-sample) of 7min, including the clean-up and the re-equilibration of the column. Evaluation of chromatographic performance revealed excellent intraday and interday reproducibility (&amp;gt;99%), resolution (&amp;gt;2.23), selectivity (&amp;gt;1.12), peak symmetry (1.24¨C1.42) while presenting low limits of detection (&amp;lt;0.40mgL6Ó11) and quantification (&amp;lt;1.34mgL6Ó11). The robustness of the method was calculated according to the concentration/dilution of the sample and the injection volume. Several combinations of methanol and ethanol with water as sample solvents were evaluated and the best chromatographic results and extraction rate were obtained using 100% methanol. Finally, the developed method was validated with different extracts of turmeric rhizome and products that use turmeric in their formulation. <br /><br /></p>

       <div> 
        <p> Conventional extraction techniques for plant phenolics are usually associated with high organic solvent consumption and long extraction times. In order to establish an environmentally friendly extraction method for grape skin phenolics, deep eutectic solvents (DES) as a green alternative to conventional solvents coupled with highly efficient microwave-assisted and ultrasound-assisted extraction methods (MAE and UAE, respectively) have been considered. Initially, screening of five different DES for proposed extraction was performed and choline chloride-based DES containing oxalic acid as a hydrogen bond donor with 25% of water was selected as the most promising one, resulting in more effective extraction of grape skin phenolic compounds compared to conventional solvents. Additionally, in our study, UAE proved to be the best extraction method with extraction efficiency superior to both MAE and conventional extraction method. The knowledge acquired in this study will contribute to further DES implementation in extraction of biologically active compounds from various plant sources. <br /><br /></p>

Quantitative variations of the phenolic compounds and their degradation products were monitored over time. The differences observed in the initial total phenolic compounds concentration (ranging between 250.77 and 925.75mg/kg) were attributed to extraction system, olive variety, and maturity stage. Even after 24months, the degree of reduction in total phenolic compounds did not exceed 31%. The reduction was more pronounced in dialdehydic forms of oleuropein and ligstroside aglycones (DAFOA and DAFLA), indicating a more active participation in the hydrolysis and oxidation processes of the more polar secoiridoids.

This MS-based glycoproteomic approach demonstrates that vacuolar invertase is glycosylated at all twelve potential N-glycosylation sites. Glycosylation is heterogeneous, with twelve glycoforms identified at six of the sites.

Quercetin-rhamno-di-hexoside (435¨C1065¦Ìg/g) and quercetin-3-O-rutinoside (159¨C629¦Ìg/g) were found to be the predominant flavonoids.

Overall, fruits of the Ningxia goji (Lycium barbarum L.) genotypes, DM (Damaye), NJ1 (Ningji No.1), BH (Baihua) and NH (Ningxiahuangguo) were not only rich in polyphenols, carotenoids and polysaccharides, but had significantly higher TAA than those of the other genotypes, suggesting that they represent an excellent source of antioxidants for human nutrition. <br /><br /></p>

        <p> In general, the risk of numerous thyroid cancers inevitably increases among people with iodine deficiencies. An iodide-doped chitosan (CT-I) solution was prepared for dipping tomatoes to coat the fresh surface with an edible film (1.5¦Ìm), thereby providing iodine-rich fruits for daily intake. Characterisation of the thin film was conducted by FTIR and SEM. Stability of the CT-I film was studied via water immersion at various time intervals, and no residual iodide leached out due to intrinsic interactions between the cationic amino group of chitosan and iodide ions. Moreover, the iodide supplement exhibited no effect on the antioxidant activity of tomatoes. The iodine content in the film-coated tomato was determined by ICP-OES. The tomato coating with 1.5% (w/v) CT-I contained approximately 0.4¦Ìg iodide per gram fresh weight. In addition, the freshness and storability of iodine-doped tomatoes were also maintained for shelf-life concerns. <br /><br /></p>

        <p> In this paper, the novel hydrophilic magnetic molecularly imprinted nanoparticles were developed for selective separation and determination of chlorogenic acid in aqueous fruit juices. The polymers were prepared by using amino-functionalized magnetic nanoparticles as carriers, branched polyethyleneimine as functional monomer, and chlorogenic acid as template molecule. Branched polyethyleneimine with abundant active amino groups could react with template sufficiently, and its unique dendritic structure may amplify the number of the imprinted cavities. Meanwhile, it would improve the hydrophilicity of imprinted materials for attaining high extraction efficiency. The resulted polymers exhibit fast kinetics, high adsorption capacity, and favorable selectivity. In addition, the obtained nanoparticles were used as solid-phase extraction sorbents for selective isolation and determination of chlorogenic acid in peach, apple, and grape juices (0.92, 4.21, and 0.75¦ÌgmL6Ó11, respectively). <br /><br /></p>

This is the first report on using the in vitro digestion model suitable for food, as proposed in a consensus paper, to assess the bioaccessibility of ¦Â-carotene in sweet potato flour. The pre-treatments produced a rearrangement of the flour matrix (starch, protein and non-starch polysaccharides), which was greater by using microwaves (M6) conducting to a greater increase in the phase transition temperatures up to 4.14&deg;C, while the enthalpy presented the higher reduction (4.49J/g), both parameters in respect to the control. The resistant starch fraction was not modified, with about 3% in all samples. Microwave (M6) and all the steam pre-treatments showed the higher bioaccessibility of ¦Â-carotene. This flour can be used in the development of new products with high ¦Â-carotene content. <br /><br /></p>
