<h2><a id="whatdoes"></a>What does a Notary  do?</h2>
<p>The need for a notary  public is dictated by the requirements of the country where the document is to  be used. For example, if you wish to buy a property abroad, it is often  necessary to give your overseas lawyer power to deal with the purchase. This  can be done by means of a power of attorney, which is signed by you in front of  a notary. The notary public will confirm your name and identity and sign the  document and seal it with their official seal. </p>

<li>confirm your single status in order to marry abroad</li> 
<li>obtain duplicate documents for lost passports or your other important documents </li> 
<li>get an Apostille (legalisation)</li>

<H5><a id="leg"></a>What is Legalisation of documents or Apostille?</h5>

<p>Many countries also require notarised documents to be 'legalised'. This is a system which exists all round the world, not just in the UK.   Legalisation is a double check to make sure that the Notary's signature is genuine. All Notaries' signatures and seals are recorded by the Foreign and Commonwealth Office. Once the authenticity of the signature is confirmed a certificate is attached, called an "Apostille". Documents may also need to be checked by foreign embassies to make sure that the Notary's signature matches the one on their records. The requirement for this will depend on the foreign country involved. </p>

<H6><a id="id"></a>What identification does a Notary Public require?</h6>

<p>One essential part of a Notary's work is to identify the people whom they see. This has always been a part of the Notary's records to ensure that documents are correctly signed and may be relied on by persons overseas.</p>
<p>Following the implementation of the Money Laundering Regulations 2003, Notaries are now obliged to keep sufficient evidence on their files of the identity and the address of all their clients before they undertake any work.</p>
<p>Each person whose signature they are to certify must provide one of the following original identification documents at the time of the appointment.</p>
<ul>
<li>valid passport </li>
<li>Driving licence (with photo card) </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, they require proof of residence, which can be one of the following original documents:</p>
<ul>
<li>Up to date printed Bank statement</li>
<li>Recent Inland revenue tax demand or self assessment statement </li>
</ul>
<p>When a Notary Public is acting for a corporate client, evidence of the due incorporation of the company or entity is required. The Notary will usually wish to make their own enquiries of the Companies Registry to obtain some documents such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Extract from the company register </li>
<li>Certificate of incorporation </li>
<li>Latest report and audited accounts </li>
<li>Up to date certified copy of partnership agreement  </li>
<li>Evidence of being regulated by a regulatory body</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the above, each individual signatory will need to produce one of the identification documents mentioned above.</p>
