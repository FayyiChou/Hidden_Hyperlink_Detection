   <h3>Jerry Jones No timetable on Prescott vs Romo call</h3> Cowboys entered the week 7 high-profile goodbye, riding the rookie's Inn Prescott and Ezekiel Eliot's Eastern NFC.
   <br /> Asked the football mind wants to know if Dallas's copper will handle a subtle quarterback situation, veteran Tony Tony Romo is due to compress fractures back.
   <br /> While respectful Prescott has admitted, &quot;This is Tony's team,&quot; Ronaldinho reported. Romo Cowboys were inclined to delay the return until he recaptured the peak football form.
   <br /> Boss Jerry Jones conceded after the victory at Green Bay Packers, told reporters that a quarterback decided to &quot;wait until the next card.&quot;
   <br /> Jones's coaching staff has been relaxed for 13 days, relaxing and enjoying Prescott-Elliott tandem as the league's topic.
   <br /> &quot;People in the years after the game we do not know what we're going to do at quarterback,&quot; Jones said. &quot;Maybe until the training camp did not know that our quarterback Romo was injured after sitting here with the coaches sitting here playing Level and Tony are getting better and better and I want to pinch myself. &quot;
   <br /> Jones appeared on the KTVT in Dallas on Tuesday to make clear that there was no timetable for the quarterback decision.
   <br /> &quot;I do not know that no one is going to be a game or a game,&quot; said Jones, of Fort Worth Star-Telegram. &quot;We do not have any idea, the most important thing is that we all look at the same music, we all feel the same,cheap soccer jerseys, the team is positive, we feel that we can make mistakes, overcome them, everyone feels good we have done. &quot;
   <br /> Jones continues to praise the role of his two central defenders and how they deal with this sentence context: &quot;If you can not get along with these two men, you'd better look in the mirror.
   <br /> NFL is a league again and again. Cowboys' locker room currently tends to keep up with Prescott in midway to change plans for every LAPPORT.
   <br /> In this connection,cheap jerseys, all indications are that the plan will be until Romo is necessary.
   <br /> &quot;You do not stop working now,&quot; Rugby network analyst Brian Bald said Monday to publish the latest in life. &quot;... you just keep Romo Tony at the bullpen. If he is Clayton Kershaw coming in here to win the game or the playoffs,cheap nfl jerseys, you do that, but you do not have to stop this train now in what to do.
   <br /> &quot;(Prescott) played so well, the team played so well, continuity, rhythm of the attack.
   <br /> Just keep it that way, Jones and trainer Jason Garrett will be the most expensive insurance policy for football on Romo Ice.
