<p><font color="ffffcc" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Both the website and the 2,500 square foot physical store are owned and operated by <b>Electric Vehicle Mall</b> at 619 Missouri Ave N in Largo, Florida 33770 (west of Tampa on the Gulf Coast).</font></p>
<p><font color="ffffcc" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Not all dealers are created equal. Experience the <u>difference</u> of dealing with a company that takes pride in providing exceptional customer service and expert technical support. There are plenty of &quot;fly-by-night&quot; dealers who have never even touched most of what they are selling, can't provide any real insight into the products they offer and cannot of course provide any expert technical support or help. By contrast, we have an physical store and have assembled, tested, serviced and repaired at one time most models and  every variation of vehicle we sell.</font></p>
<p><font color="ffffcc" size="4" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Have you ordered something from someone that immediately charged your credit card and never told you that it was out of stock until you called them weeks later to find out why you had not received it? This is not the case with Electric Vehicle Mall. We do not charge customer cards until we order the product to be shipped from the warehouse and if that product sells out in the requested color before it is shipped, we let our customers know right away and offer the customer a choice of an immediate refund, a different color or a similar bike or scooter. We will never play games with your hard earned money.</font></p>
