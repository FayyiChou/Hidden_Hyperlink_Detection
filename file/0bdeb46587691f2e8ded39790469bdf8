As distribution channels expanded, BeyondCurious designed and built a “digital companion” app that trains, educates and inspires brick-and-mortar sales associates at big box stores and mom and pop surf shops alike. Finally, the rapid increase in sales demanded a world-class order management system. BeyondCurious created a first of its kind B2B Sales Portal using GoPro’s existing NetSuite platform that moved sales from offline phone and fax ordering to online self-service.\n\n**Business Impact: **\n- Digital companion app launched in 9 languages, across 4 continents\n- New product information – and training initiatives - distributed instantly across entire global sales force\n- Product returns (especially at big box retailers) reduced significantly\n- Camera accessory sales increased sharply\n- Total revenue rose to $985.7 million in 2013 from 64.5 million in 2011","context":"GoPro, one of the fastest growing brands in consumer electronics, is famous for pioneering the revolutionary concept of wearable cameras. But GoPro had quickly maximized penetration in its core market and needed to find and reach new markets.","howWeDidIt":"1) GO BEYOND THE CORE\n\nBeyondCurious engaged with GoPro in a 3-week CatalystGo – our rapid ideation methodology. Through a combination of data-driven and behavioral insights, we identified new customer segments and new markets that allowed GoPro to go beyond its core. BeyondCurious was able to reframe the problem by thinking laterally, help GoPro deepen their understanding of the opportunity through innovative concepts, and align all stakeholders on the path forward. \n\n2) RAPIDLY SCALE DISTRIBUTION CHANNEL \n\nIn order to reach a broader audience and global markets, GoPro needed to rapidly scale its distribution channel. GoPro needed a way to not only educate its captive and non-captive sales force but also to support its ongoing channel needs as products evolved. To solve this challenge, BeyondCurious recommended building a mobile app that engaged, educated and empowered sales associates, while becoming a tool to connect with consumers in the retail store. The GoPro Retail Training App has transformed the salesperson’s relationship with the GoPro brand and its products. The award-winning app was built in 10 weeks, is powered by the cloud and has been deployed globally. On-the-fly content updates and integration with GoPro’s incredibly active social channels bring the excitement of the GoPro experience in store. Supporting every sales context from specialty retail to big box to international, the innovative app is used by millions across the globe. This app has helped GoPro rapidly scale its distribution channel with the company’s growth, dramatically reducing operational cost while significantly increasing conversion at the point of sale.\n\n3) DRIVE EFFICIENCIES INTERNALLY TO DO MORE WITH LESS\n\nGoPro’s product sales were skyrocketing. However most B2B sales transactions were still handled manually causing delays, errors and increasing costs. These manual processes limited GoPro’s ability to make the most of its growth opportunity. BeyondCurious recommended a B2B sales portal that automated the entire process and moved GoPro’s B2B customers from offline to online ordering. \nBeyondCurious helped GoPro leverage its investment in the NetSuite platform and created a first of its kind portal that provided a highly immersive experience to its distributors, enabled self-service, and promoted up selling and cross selling. This B2B portal helped GoPro decrease customer acquisition costs, significantly reduced commerce related errors and delays, increase customer loyalty and spend, and rapidly scale globally.","impact":"GoPro 64.5 million in revenue in 2011, 985.7 million in revenue in 2013","gridImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8sdv8fsqgokz"}},"id":"5mGcbU8UiA4GU4MCKqaGoK","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2015-11-05T09:53:52.045Z","updatedAt":"2015-11-05T09:53:52.045Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"gopro 1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/8sdv8fsqgokz/5mGcbU8UiA4GU4MCKqaGoK/7b4642d9b8457a655a9f5649c30f1e21/gopro_1.jpg","details":{"size":622257,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1200}},"fileName":"gopro_1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"mainImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8sdv8fsqgokz"}},"id":"7LROdN3QT6Scqssc40EGE8","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2015-11-05T09:54:06.683Z","updatedAt":"2015-11-05T09:54:06.683Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"Gopro bkground","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/8sdv8fsqgokz/7LROdN3QT6Scqssc40EGE8/167f82dbee939e1a4b9253f3a54c668a/Gopro_bkground.jpg","details":{"size":5227041,"image":{"width":4000,"height":2666}},"fileName":"Gopro_bkground.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"contextImage":{"sys":{"space":{"sys":{"type":"Link","linkType":"Space","id":"8sdv8fsqgokz"}},"id":"2XkChJUeqAMw22Ay6kkqaY","type":"Asset","createdAt":"2015-11-05T09:54:20.392Z","updatedAt":"2015-11-05T09:54:20.393Z","revision":1,"locale":"en-US"},"fields":{"title":"gopro 1","file":{"url":"//images.contentful.com/8sdv8fsqgokz/2XkChJUeqAMw22Ay6kkqaY/5eabe59a91916bc3ce4607a3bec64c6f/gopro_1.jpg","details":{"size":622257,"image":{"width":1920,"height":1200}},"fileName":"gopro_1.jpg","contentType":"image/jpeg"}}},"weight":1,"intent":null,"challengeStatement":{"title":"How does a challenger brand win in retail?","description":"GoPro was at the cusp of explosive growth.

The technology of the site was enhanced to identify popular content, posts, and searches and then surface those modules dynamically.
