<h3 align="left">Six stories including: Flying by the Seat of her Panties, by A.L. Purvis</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>She balked. She opened her mouth to say something, but thought better of it. Her blush deepened. Finally, she lowered her head, and then lowered her pants a little, to about where most plumbers wear their britches. She kept her head down as she shuffled over to my side and leaned over the landing zone. I eased her down over my knees and started to pull her stretch pants further down. &quot;No!&quot; she said. She reached back with her right hand to stop the decent of her waistband. I caught her right wrist and moved it to the middle of her lower back and held it there with my left hand. I pressed my left forearm down on her spine, so she couldn't get up. With her black pants at mid thigh, I was free to admire the seat of her sensible white panties, stretched as tight a the head on a kettle drum around her expansive rear end. The sound my hand would make on this drum would be much fleshier than the sound I make on the kettle drum I play in the orchestra, but I was sure it would make Jeannette want to march. I also knew she would soon provide vocal accompaniment, and no doubt a bit of high harmony before I was through with her.</p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: On the Job Training, by Dr. Ken</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Rita's bottom was literally bouncing under Mike's palm, and turning redder all the time. Rita began pleading for him to stop, and promising that she would pass the lesson. When her voice finally conveyed the right measure of sincerity, he stopped. She hung limply over his lap. He rubbed her backside for a few seconds, and then told her to get up. She slowly made it to her feet, wincing at the throbbing of her well-smacked bottom. She rubbed her behind for a moment or two, and then slowly and carefully pulled her panties and sweatpants up and into place.</p>

<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>”You wouldn't dare!”</p>
    <p>”I wouldn't, would I?” he'd said. He grabbed her by the arm, pulled her up, sat down in his chair and even though Cecilia was a big girl he could easily bend her over his knees where she hung like a fish out of water, arms flailing and legs kicking. Just as easily as he took her across his knees he held her in place and didn't pay any attention to her arms or legs.</p>
    <p>There was just one part of her body he saw. In her bent over position Cecilia's dress clung to that part as if its life depended on it and Sandgren contemplated the charming and inviting curves underneath. It was plain she wasn't wearing a girdle.</p>

<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>“But it stings!” Sally protested. Never the less she put her hands in front of her. She was frightened and did not want to anger her father further. The strap had made a white line across both buttocks when it landed but as blood rushed in the line was now turning a bright pink.</p>
    <p>“CRACK!” The leather strap landed a second time making another line next to the first. Sally jerked her bottom and called out again but managed to keep her hands on the car hood. </p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: Party Time, by Annie</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Smack! &quot;What about getting drunk?&quot; Smack! &quot;What about hanging all over half the guys at the party?&quot; Smack! &quot;What about telling your friend Pam that you wished you had never married me?&quot; Smack! &quot;What about causing a scene because you wanted to drive home?&quot; Smack! &quot;What about fighting with me all the way home AND after we got here?&quot;</p>
    <p>Smack! Smack! &quot;I guess since all you did at the party was have a good time, then you can just stare at the floor for a time while I have a good time!&quot; Smack! Smack!</p>
    <p>I was really feeling each hard spank of Scott's hand. After everything he had just said, I had a sinking feeling that I wouldn't be getting up anytime soon. Just then he seemed to pick up the pace, with no more pauses for talking. Very quickly the heat in my ass felt like someone set me on fire! I was squealing, and wiggling as much as I could.</p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: Rob, by Alexia</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>I scowled, but didn't stomp my foot. It was just my luck that Rob remembered that incident a year ago, when I was so engrossed in following an enormous blue-scrawled filefish that I got separated from the group and had to go to the surface and find my way back to the Bad Dog myself. Rob was furious, but Jess was cool and determined. He bent me over the starboard rail, peeled down my bikini briefs, and spanked me long and hard until I was howling with the sting of it and flailing like a fish out of water. After the spanking I had to go directly to Rob and apologize for my stupidity. If I wasn't already shamed enough to want to die, I then had to endure the dive-master's scathing lecture about safety, delivered in front of the rest of the group that had then arrived back on board. The crisp staccato of his voice echoed out across the water, and I imagined the whole resort knew of it.</p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: A Necessary Return to Spanking, by Don Barton</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Debbie made every effort to take the sway out of her walk and be calm as she slowly walked up the stairs and down the hall to her room. </p>
    <p>Entering her bedroom, Debbie plopped herself down on her bed - her bottom hitting the bed far softer than her bare bottom would be getting swatted very shortly - and waited - waited for her first bare-bottomed spanking - in fact, her first and only spanking since her last one a long three years ago.</p>
    <p>Waiting on her bed, Debbie remembered how vicious the last spanking her father had given her had been (it had been one of the few times he'd ever used the razor strap on her), for yelling and swearing at her mother while her mother was scolding her for a bad report card, and over the years, she had been very thankful that it had been her last spanking. Her last one until now, that is.</p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: Daddy Borrow a Paddle, by Tess</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>My father never spanked me until I was nineteen. Until then I was always punished by a variety of grounding, allowance withholding, privileges revoked, and just plain general disapproval and lectures. I had to admit that I preferred spanking, but this admission was never made, of course, when I was actually over someone's knees!</p>

<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>Ken looked her up and down, then shook his head. &quot;A fancy hairdo, a lot of makeup, a slinky dress ... what you look like, Joella, is a little girl playing at being a slut. And the immature, irresponsible way you've acted tonight goes a long way in showing me that you aren't grown up. Also that it's been too long since you got your butt blistered or you wouldn't even think of acting like you did tonight. I reckon your Dad can straighten you out real damned fast...but I'm going to add my bit right now if you don't get down here by the count of three. One...two...&quot;</p>

<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>&quot;Very well, young lady. You have now earned 10 extra spanks for dawdling! If I have to come and get you it will be 25 extra!&quot; Lisa finally snapped out of it and made her way over to her governess' side. Emily reached up and grabbed her, dragging her over her lap. She took a moment to adjust the naughty girl on her lap, then lifted her dress up to her slender waist. Although she knew it was coming, Lisa still cried out in horror as Emily pulled her white nylon panties down to her knees. With the decks cleared for action, Emily raised the hairbrush and brought it down decisively across both dimpled cheeks. Again the study was filled with the sound of a solid wooden hairbrush spanking soft feminine flesh and the anguished cries of one very sore teenager.</p>

<h3 align="left">Six stories including: Little Red Riding Hood, by Alexia</h3>
<div class="PostContent">
  <blockquote>
    <p>And then she was tumbling off his lap and landing on her tender bottom in the scratchy, coarse straw. The confused and smarting girl scrambled to her feet and hastily pulled up the dropflap to her pantaloons, dashed away from the shed as fast as her legs could carry her, and leapt to her pony's back. Her startled groan as her sore nether regions met with the pony's broad back frightened the beast into a canter, which in turn made poor Rosa sorer still.</p>
    <p>Behind her there was a roaring, devilish laugh that faded as her pony plunged back into the forest.<br />
      It was a much shorter ride home for Rosa than the way out had been, for the pony took the most direct route and arrived in its own paddock less than ten minutes after its mistress ran from the shed, the spanking, and the forester's humor. Rosa flung herself down and ran for her room in the cottage where she stayed for the rest of the afternoon, shamed and once again angry.</p>

                          <p>We are ALL into spanking. And we're into stories.   ABCD Webmasters is the largest web publisher of spanking stories and CF   Publications is the world's largest print publisher. Since 1980, CF Publications   has raised more skirts, lowered more panties, dropped more trousers, bared more   bottoms, and reddened more deserving backsides than anyone else in   spanking-land. Now, through the Spanking Story Archive, you will have an   opportunity to enjoy an amazing number of CF's archived stories, some not   offered in catalogs in more than ten years.</p>

                            <p align="justify">The members' area of the site contains   approximately 80 stories. We have Male/Female, Female/Male, and Female/Female.   We have no-nonsense husbands, traditional pastors, and disciplinary wives. We   have stories set in times past, and in the future. We have paddles, hairbrushes,   straps, canes, hands (of course), birch rods, maybe even the occasional razor   strop. If you want to read spanking stories, this is the place for you! You get   every one of these stories as soon as you join.</p>
