            </div>
            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Sports massage is an umbrella term and generally can be described as one of four specific massage treatments: 
						<ul>
							<li>Pre/Post event massage (i.e. before or after a running event, rugby match etc.)</li>
							<li>General sports/deep tissue massage (often referred to as “maintenance massage”)</li>
							<li>Treatment of sports injuries and minor aches (such as tennis elbow, back and shoulder pain etc.)</li>
						</ul>
						Sports massage has a variety of techniques at its disposal. There is a huge long list I could add here but I’ll resist. It’s safe to say that during Sports and Remedial Massage treatments I use 99% of the time use my hands as the primary means of treatment. From time to time I may use other techniques such as Instrument Assisted Soft Tissue Manipulation (IASTM) or kinesiology taping to help. The treatment is focused on the area that is not only painful but the area that is causing the pain. This is important to restore balance and help your body's natural internal mechanisms of healing. 
						Overall, Sports massage can help you by:
						<ul>
							<li>Remodelling scar tissue from previous injuries or surgery</li>
 							<li>Induces a psychological 'feel good factor'</li> 
							<li>Speed up recovery by removing metabolic waste</li>
 							<li>Reduce pain levels</li>
 							<li>Mechanically stretches muscle tissue and fascia and mobilises ligaments and tendons keeping them supple and pliable</li> 
							<li>Improved training and event performance</li>
						</ul>
						This is not an exhaustive list but should give you a great indication as to how Sports and Remedial Massage can help. </p>

              <h2>Relax & unwind massage</h2>
              
              <h3><strong>A Swedish style massage adapted to your needs - pure relaxation</strong></h3>
            </div>
            <div class="entry-content">
              <p>Relaxation & unwind massage is a gentle Swedish style massage that uses smooth, gliding strokes to help you relax. Generally it will be at a slower pace and use lighter pressure than a sports massage, but I’m happy to adapt to your needs. Just tell me what your preference is. <br><br>Relax and unwind massages are aimed to give you a sensual, deeply relaxing experience.
					There is less emphasis on working out serious adhesions or "knots" in the muscle tissue, which can be uncomfortable and cause some people to tense up against the pressure. In a relaxation massage, the therapist won't push your pain limits in order to get the muscle to release. You might even fall asleep! <br>It's a good choice for someone who is getting a massage for the first time or someone who just wants to bring their stress level down. 
					Relax & unwind massage is also perfect as a special treat or gift. <br>
					It's not realistic to expect that you can get rid of all your knots, stresses and strains in one massage. But if you wish to drift into a deeply relaxed state in sixty minutes that's achievable.
					<br><br>There are substantial health benefits to a relaxation massage. Gentle massage stimulates sensory nerve endings in the skin, which transmit messages through the nervous system and cause the brain to release endorphins. These are the body's natural painkillers, feel-good chemicals that create a sense of well-being.
					Massage further aids relaxation by stimulating the body's parasympathetic nervous system, blood pressure decreases, and heart rate slows, Relaxation & unwind massage also increases the blood circulation and stimulates the body's lymphatic system, which carries away waste products.</p>

            <h2>About me</h2>
            <p>Having worked for far too long in a corporate setting I trained in yoga and massage back when I still  lived in London, where I worked in an Advertising and Publishing agency. I decided in 2012 it was time for a change in scenery, moved to Glasgow and started teaching yoga in various studios across the city. Initially massage was more a sideline, but kept growing over the years. In 2016 I finally dared to open my own massage studio in central Glasgow. </p>
            <p>I work form a spacious and light treatment room in the heart of the city – right opposite Glasgow Central station. Through my extensive experience in the yoga and fitness industry, I have a very good understanding of the moving body and use this knowledge in my massage treatments – ensuring you’ll get the best sports massage possible. </p>
            <p>I’m fully insured and also registered with <a href=”http://http://www.sportstherapyorganisation.org.uk” target="_blank"> STO – Sports Therapy Organisation</a>,<a href=”http://www.scotmass.co.uk” target="_blank"> SMTO – Scottish Massage Therapists Organisation</a> and <a href=”http://www.cnhc.org.uk” target="_blank"> CNHC, the Complementary and Natural Healthcare Council</a>. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-info">
              <h3>Where are you based?</h3>
              <p>The address is Suite 365 (4th floor), 93 Hope Street, Glasgow, G2 6LD. That’s right opposite Glasgow Central Station. The building is called Central Chambers, please use the entrance right next to Cafe Nero. 
					Inside the building take the stairs/lift up to the 4th floor, turn left and then it will be the 4th door on the left hand side. It’s a lime green door with my name on it.</p> 

					<h3>Timing:</h3>
					<p>Please arrive about 5 minutes before the booked time slot for your first treatment as this will allow you to fill in the health check list without using up your treatment time. You will only have to fill this in once before your first appointment. 
					I leave generally 15 minutes between appointments to prepare the room, so you should be fine arriving a little early (there is a sign on the door indicating whether I’m still with a client or not). 
					Unfortunately I do not have a waiting area, if you arrive way too early I can recommend the coffee shop on the ground floor.</p> 
					<h3>Assessment:</h3>
					<p>For Relax & Unwind treatments there is usually no assessment as these are purely to de-stress. However, you will have to fill in a health questionnaire before your first treatment. 
					For all other treatments there will usually be an assessment in the beginning. Depending on the reason for the treatment, the length and details of the assessment can obviously vary (for example: range of motion test, posture, pain levels etc.). If it’s just a “maintenance massage” the assessment can be as simple as asking a few questions. 
					I can’t stress enough that a thorough assessment is an important first step to a successful treatment and is therefore part of the treatment time. Please note that an assessment is not the same as a diagnosis from a medical professional such as a GP. I’m a massage therapist, not a doctor. </p>
            	<h3>Preganancy massage:</h3>
				<p>Unfortunately I don’t offer pregnancy massage. </p>

            </div>
            <div class="service-info">
              <h3>(Un)dress code:</h3>
					<p>To work effectively on your soft tissue I need to be able to access the skin in the treated area.  Ideally this means you’ll undress down to your underwear. For women removing the bra gives better access to the shoulder and upper back area, however you can decide what you’re comfortable with and I’ll work around it. For men (sport)briefs are preferable to boxer shorts as they make it easier to access the glutes. 
					Your body will be covered with towels throughout the treatment. Only the part currently worked on will be uncovered. 
					For sports massage it is also a good idea to bring a pair of shorts, especially if the hip area is to be treated or if movements need to be assessed.</p> 
           <h3>Do you offer home or hotel visits?</h3> 
				<p>Unfortunately I don’t offer home/hotel visits at the moment.</p> 

				<h3>Importance of feedback</h3>
				<p>Client feedback is very important. If something doesn’t feel right, let me know immediately and don’t wait until after the treatment. That way I can change the treatment, ensuring you’ll get the best massage possible. Likewise if something feels really good let me know during the treatment.<p> 


				<h3>Is there an age limit?</h3> 
				<p>I’m happy to treat clients of all ages. However, anyone under the age of 16 will have to be accompanied by a responsible adult (parent/guardian). The responsible adult must be present throughout the treatment.</p> 

				<h3>What type of oil do you use?</h3> 
				<p>My favourite oil is a water-dispersible mix of soy and coconut oil, however I have a variety of other oils, creams and massage waxes in my treatment room. I change them depending on treatment needs. If you have any allergies or are sensitive to certain ingredients, please let me know.  I have hypoallergenic oil in stock (nut, soy and fragrance free). </p>

              <p>While everyone likes a massage, sometimes it’s not a good idea to have one or at least get medical advice beforehand. The following list seems probably long and scary, but it’s mostly common sense. If you have any other conditions, you’re unsure of, just contact me.
