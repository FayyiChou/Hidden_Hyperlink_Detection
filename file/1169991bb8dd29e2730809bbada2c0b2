A 
Practice after practice, he eagerly gave everything he had. But being half the size of the other boys, he got absolutely nowhere. At all the games, this hopeful athlete sat on the bench and hardly ever played. This teenager lived alone with his father, and the two of them had a very special relationship. The son was always on the bench, and his father was always in the stands cheering. When entering high school, Jim never missed a practice or a game, but remained a bench warmer(候补球员) all four years. His father continued to encourage him but also made it very clear that he didn’t have to play football if he didn’t want to. 
When the young man went to college, he decided to try out for the football team as a “walk-on(临时队员)”. Everyone was sure he could never make the cut, but he did. The news that he had survived the cut thrilled him so much that he rushed to the nearest phone and called his father. His father was sent season tickets for all the college games.
One day as he stayed on the bench, the coach met him with a telegram. Jim read it and became deathly silent. He mumbled, “My father died this morning. Is it all right if I miss the practice today?” The coach put his arm gently around him and said, “Take the rest of the week off. Don’t even plan to come back to the game on Saturday.” 
Saturday arrived, and the game was not going well. In the third quarter, when the team was ten points behind, a young man quietly ran onto the sidelines. Everyone was astounded to see their faithful teammate back so soon.
“Coach, please let me play. I have just to play today,” said Jim. The coach pretended not to hear him. There was no way he wanted his worst player in this close playoff game. But Jim persisted. Finally, the coach gave in.
Everyone could not believe their eyes. Jim, who had never played before, was doing everything right. He ran, passed, blocked and tackled like a star. The score was soon tied. In the closing seconds, Jim intercepted(拦截) a pass and ran all the way for the winning touchdown.
After the game, the coach came to Jim and said, “I can’t believe it. Tell me what got into you?” Jim, with tears in his eyes, said, “My dad was blind. He came to all my games, but today was the first time he could see me play, and I wanted to show him I could do it!”
36. When Jim studied in high school, ________.
  	A. his father ordered him to play football    	B. he seldom practiced 
  	C. he became interested in playing football      
	D. he never played in any football game
37. The coach, at first, refused Jim’s request to play in the game on Saturday because _______.
  	A. Jim was just a bench warmer              	B. he cared more about Jim’s health
  	C. the game was going to its end              	D. he didn’t think Jim could play well
38. Which of the following is TRUE according to the passage?

Basketball is one of the most popular team sports in the world. Skill, not strength and speed, is the key. People of all ages play the game in school gyms, local men’s and women’s clubs or on outdoor concrete courts located in parks, in backyards or on driveways. Those with physical disabilities play wheelchair basketball. Men and women play the game professionally, some earning millions of dollars a year. This is certainly a far cry from James Naismith’s expectations when he nailed two peach baskets on opposite walls of a school gymnasium. 
Canadian James Naismith was born in Almonte, Ontario, and was a graduate of McGill University and the Presbyterian Theological College. In 1891 one of the various courses he taught at the International Young Men’s Christian Training College in Springfield, Massachusetts, was physical education. Summer was over and he needed a way to keep a group of bored, trouble-making young men interested in their gym class. Naismith, who was a true advocate of the motto, “Healthy body, healthy mind”, was quite determined to get the young men in his class actively interested in sports by coming up with a new indoor game for them to play. 
By December 21, 1891, Naismith had compiled a rough list of 13 basic rules, posted them on the school bulletin(公告) board and with the assistance of the janitor(守卫), nailed two peach baskets on opposite ends of the gymnasium. He even managed to convince the janitor to climb a ladder and retrieve the ball each time a player successfully landed it in a peach basket. 
Students loved the game and it wasn’t long before schools and colleges across the country caught basketball fever and introduced the game to their own institutions. The last thing Naismith did was invent a name for his wildly successful game. A few of his students suggested Naismith-ball, but he decided that would never work and they eventually settled on basketball. 
The popularity of basketball spread quickly. Basketball was introduced in many nations as early as 1893. And it was introduced at the Berlin Olympics in 1936. Naismith was flown to Berlin to watch the games. He spent the remainder of his life teaching physical education and died in Lawrence, Kansas, in 1939.
41. At the International Young Men’s Christian Training College, James Naismith ________.
	A. was a student majoring in physical education 
	B. also taught other courses besides physical education
	C. only taught physical education
	D. got interested in many courses
42. James Naismith wanted to invent a new indoor game to ______.
	A. make the group of young men become outstanding basketball players
	B. prevent the group of young men from making trouble
	C. make the group of young men healthy in their mind and body
	D. make the group of young men get interested in sports
43. The underlined word “retrieve” in the third paragraph probably means “________”.
	A. get back       	  B. put back  	C. put away 		  D. pick up
44. We can learn from the last two paragraphs that the game_________.
	A. became a success                          	B. was first named after Naismith 
	C. quickly became popular across the whole world
	D. was finally named by Naismith
45. We can learn from the passage that Naismith ________. 
	A. didn’t live to see the game of basketball played at the Olympics
	B. earned a lot of money by introducing the game into other countries
	C. hadn’t expected the game he invented would become so popular
	D. enjoyed great fame after the game of basketball became popular

The oldest female athlete at the World Masters Games in Sydney has broken a world record in the shot put (推铅球) at the age of 100.
Ruth Frith competed in the women’s shot put final at the World Masters Games in Sydney Olympic Park on October 11, 2009. All eyes were on Ruth Frith, from Brisbane, as she arrived, hoping to win gold in the shot put and feeling pretty confident as she was the only competitor in the over-100s category. But her 4.07-meter throw on Sunday didn’t just win her gold, but also broke a world record. “As long as I didn’t foul (犯规) I was going to win it,” Frith told reporters.
The great-grandmother is also wild about other events and believes other people who have retired should follow her example. Frith trains five days a week, regularly lifting 35 kg weights. She doesn’t drink or smoke and she doesn’t eat vegetables, claiming she hasn’t liked them since she was young. Frith was clearly a star of the World Masters Games, an event which attracts about 28,000 athletes. And despite her age, Frith said she had no plans to retire just yet. She contested her first World Masters Athletics Championships at the age of 74.
The World Masters Games have been held every four years since they began in Toronto in 1985, according to their website www.2009worldmasters.com. Open to people of all abilities and most ages, the games are the world’s largest multi-sport event, attracting twice as many competitors than the Olympic Games.
The main difference between the World Masters Games and the Olympic Games is that the World Masters Games are open to people of all abilities rather than just the best athletes, with the emphasis on people’s participation.
46. Ruth Frith was sure to win gold in the shot put because __________.
  	A. all the audiences supported her and gave her confidence
  	B. there was only one athlete competing in the over-100s category
  	C. she was more experienced than all the other competitors
  	D. all the other athletes were unlucky and broke the game’s rules
47. Which of the following is TRUE about Ruth Frith?
  	A. She has been keeping regular training all along.
  	B. She is a vegetarian.
  	C. She participates in the World Masters Games in order to break a world record.
  	D. She won her first championship at the age of 74.
48. The World Masters Games held in Sydney in 2009 is the __________.
  	A. fourth          	B. fifth      	C. sixth           	D. seventh
49. What can be inferred from the passage?
  	A. Ruth Frith would win more medals if she were younger.
  	B. More and more old people would join in the shot put.
  	C. The World Masters Games have almost no age limitation.
  	D. The World Masters Games are the most influential of all.
50. The World Masters Games pay more attention to __________.
  	A. the numbers of competitors      	B. the winning of gold medals
	C. the numbers of events		D. people’s participation
D
To most people, sharks are considered animals with whom none wants to cross paths. Perhaps for that reason, declining shark populations receive less attention.
The Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) made one of the earliest shark conservation efforts, developing an International Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks. 
Despite this early conservation effort, over the past decade shark populations continued to decline. The latest Atlantic Shark Study, for example, notes: “The release of the first assessment of northeast Atlantic sharks by The World Conservation Union (IUCN) shows that 26 percent are threatened with extinction and another 20 percent are in the Near Threatened category.”
Because many shark species swim in oceans that cross many countries, working out a workable shark management plan faces many roadblocks. In December 2008, member states of the Convention Migratory Species (CMS) met to discuss the issue, stating, “Action is badly needed to maintain migratory(迁移的) shark populations globally, which according to IUCN data are more threatened than those which do not migrate.”
They agreed to go on with another voluntary action plan to manage migratory shark populations.
The issue of declining shark populations extends beyond the loss of a couple of species. It possibly means large changes in ocean ecosystems.
Their status as predators(掠食者) at the top of the ocean food chain means declining shark populations is often related with increases in the populations of their preferred preys(猎物). A chain reaction sets in with the increased population of lesser predators causing decreases in populations of their preys.
Reports on declines in the bay scallop(海湾扇贝) fishing industry, for example, are linked to decreases in the shark population. As shark populations declined, the populations of one of their preferred preys, cownose rays, increased. The cownose rays then began feeding more easily on bay scallops.
51. People pay little attention to the fact that the number of sharks is decreasing probably because _________.
A. sharks attack people every day         	B. there are too many sharks 
  	C. people have negative impressions of sharks    
	D. people can’t make money from sharks
52. According to the passage, if sharks disappear in oceans, __________.
  	A. their preferred preys will decrease         	B. the fishing industry will be ruined 
  	C. bay scallops will get a good habitat       	D. ocean ecosystems will be affected
53. The International Plan of Action for the Conservation of Sharks seems to be __________.
	A. practical         B. unworkable         	C. dangerous         	D. costly
54. From the passage, we can learn that sharks __________.
  	A. only feed on cownose rays               
	B. have the highest status in the food chain
  	C. always stay in the same ocean            
	D. are the most deadly predators in the ocean
55. According to the author, __________.
  	A. we should take measures to protect sharks
  	B. people will be safe without sharks in oceans
  	C. sharks are not in danger of disappearing from the earth 
  	D. sharks are so valuable that they should be made full use of
四、书面表达(共两节，满分45分)
第一节 阅读表达(共5小题；每小题3分，满分15分)
阅读下面短文，并回答问题（请注意问题后的词数要求）。
Everyone has talent, but not everyone enjoys success with their talent. How many talented people never find success? The understanding is that there must be more factors than mere talent that contribute to a higher level of personal success. Possessing talent or being talented is never enough to achieve success in life.
Dr. John Maxwell has developed Talent Is Never Enough. The goal of the book is to help people apply specific skills and daily discipline to their current talent levels. The only way to genuinely achieve success in life is to apply good choices to talent and rise above the crowd.
John Maxwell proposes that talented people need more than their gifts to __________. There must be something that is more important than talent. Maxwell describes that talent plus people are much more likely to achieve success than those with just talent alone.
People who possess talent must be willing to make the right choices to maximize (使最大化) their talent. Wrong choices will minimize their talent and prevent them from rising to higher levels in life. Maximizing talent requires people to make good choices and figure out there being specific things. Dr. Maxwell identifies many different choices that people make to become a talent plus person. These choices include practice sharpens talent, responsibility strengthens talent, perseverance keeps talent, courage tests talent and teamwork multiplies talent, etc.
Following the simple principles can help people not only raise the level of their talent but also raise their level of living. When people apply the principles to their talents, they can become a talent plus person. Talent plus people have the ability to change their life and the world.
56. Why did Dr. John Maxwell write the book? (no more than 10 words)

Monday   March 1, 2010			Sunny
Today is the first day of the new school term. I was asked to help our new foreign teacher, Mr. Smith, a handsome gentleman from England, to get to know about our school life.
In the morning, I got up early to pick him up at the airport. We took a taxi to our school. Since Mr. Smith knows little of Chinese, I worked as his interpreter, helping him finish all the procedure for registration. When I was helping him arrange his luggage, he told me that he liked the apartment provided by our school. 
In the afternoon, I showed him around our campus. We visited the library and the teaching building. Mr. Smith is an easy-going man and he praised me for my oral English. I invited him to the canteen of our school for supper. It was the first time he had eaten in a Chinese school canteen and he enjoyed it very much.
