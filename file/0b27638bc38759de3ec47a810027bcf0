					<p>Commercial cleaning is broad term predominantly used by the commercial companies which earn an income by being contracted by individuals, businesses or corporations to carry out cleaning services in a variety of premises. Cleaning companies can be found in virtually every town and city in the world, with a higher concentration in the affluent regions. <strong>Commercial cleaning</strong> facilities are mainly used by shops, corporate offices, showrooms, warehouses, schools, factories, airports, government offices, etc.</p>
<p>Commercial office cleaning companies use a wide variety of cleaning methods, chemicals, and equipment to facilitate and expedite the cleaning process. The scope of work may include all internal, general and routine cleaning &#8211; including floors, tiles, partition walls, internal walls, suspended ceilings, lighting, furniture and cleaning, window cleaning, deep cleans of sanitary conveniences and washing facilities, kitchens and dining areas, consumables and feminine hygiene facilities as well as cleaning of telephones, IT, and other periodic cleaning as required. Carpet cleaning though, even with regular vacuuming, needs hot water extraction applied every 18 to 24 months. External cleaning, litter picking, and removal of graffiti may also be incorporated.</p>

<p>The <strong><a href="http://empirecapitol.com/">commercial cleaning toronto</a></strong> industry is extremely competitive now-a-days. People are responsible for their own household cleaning but when it comes to their working places, there is no more responsibilities associated with cleaning the working place. Therefore, to keep the working laces clean and hygienic, there is a need of commercial cleaning company who is expert in its work. Employees of the <strong>commercial cleaning</strong> companies should be well trained so that they can complete their work with full efficiency.Therefore, there are some famous commercial cleaning companies which give proper training to their employees because of non-existence of the tertiary based training for the cleaning industry. Individuals employed in commercial cleaning typically hold the job title of janitor, custodian, or day porter.In Australia and the US, commercial cleaning companies are encouraged to screen all employees for evidence of a criminal background. In some countries, such as the United Kingdom, cleaners working in schools, children&#8217;s care homes and childcare premises are required by law to undergo a criminal record check for safety purpose. Various types of hazardous chemicals such as drain cleaners are used in the cleaning industry and the new trend in the cleaning industry is to eliminate the use of such hazardous chemicals because these chemicals are very harmful with respect to environmental concerns.</p>

					<div class="timestamp"><a href="http://www.ermeni.org/sexual-assault/" rel="bookmark" title="Permalink to Sexual Assault">March 20, 2016</a> <!-- by Noelle --> //</div> <div class="comment-bubble"><a href="http://www.ermeni.org/sexual-assault/#respond">0</a></div>					<div class="clearboth"><!-- --></div>

				<div class="post-content">
					<p>Sexual Assault is defined as an assault which is committed in the circumstances of a sexual nature such that the sexual integrity of the victim is violated. <a href="http://samgoldstein.ca/harm-and-aggravated-assault.php">toronto sexual assault</a> charges are some of the most serious charges anyone can face. Conviction will often lead to a stigmatizing criminal record, the inclusion on various sex offender registries, and sometimes significant jail time. It is a very serious crime and aggressively prosecuted. It is also important to note that the act of sexual assault does not depend solely on contact with any specific part of human anatomy but rather than the act is of a sexual nature that violates the sexual integrity of the victim. Sexual assault charges can put a heavy strain on the accused and their families. The process is often lengthy and uncertain. If you know someone who is accused of such type of charges, then you should seek help from a <strong>sexual assault lawyer</strong> or a lawyer who has experience in defending these types of charges.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-40 aligncenter" src="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-8.jpg" alt="download (8)" width="277" height="182" /></p>
<p>There are three offences of sexual assault outlined in the Criminal Code that criminalize sexual assault depending on their varying degree of severity:</p>
<p><strong>Section 271: </strong></p>
<p>Sexual assault (encompasses all assaults of a sexual nature violating the sexual integrity of the victim not covered by the other two provisions).</p>
<p><strong>Section 272: </strong></p>
<p>Sexual assault with a weapon, threats to a third party or causing bodily harm can arise in four situations when a person who while committing a sexual assault, also does one of  the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Carries, uses or threatens to use a weapon or an imitation of a weapon.</li>
<li>Threatens to cause bodily harm to a person other than the complainant.</li>
<li>Causes bodily harm to the complainant.</li>
<li>Is a party to the offence with any other person.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Section 273: </strong></p>
<p>Aggravated sexual assault occurs when an accused, in committing a sexual assault, wounds, maims, disfigures or endangers the life of the complaint.</p>
<p>Each sexual assault case has its own particular facts, and to each person accused of this type of offence, the defense is extremely important. Sexual assault cases typically benefit from extensive pretrial investigation, preparation, and knowledge of possible defenses. That’s why it is very important that if a person is accused of such type of charges, he should seek help from a <strong>sexual assault lawyer</strong> because the lawyer will have idea about all the scenarios and he can defend his clients in a better way. The Toronto Criminal lawyers have significant experience defending sexual offences alleged to have occurred against children, specifically sexual interference and child pornography allegations.  They carefully defend a range of sexual assault allegations, including offences against children. Beyond the potential for severe penal sanctions, a conviction of sexual assault has profound employment, travel and social consequences.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-41 aligncenter" src="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/download-10.jpg" alt="download (10)" width="291" height="173" /></p>
<p>Although allegations of sexual assault are frequently associated with serious offenders, <strong>sexual assault lawyers </strong>frequently observe law abiding citizens and professional confronted with these allegations in the context of marital or relationship disputes. When defending these allegations, the <strong>sexual assault lawyers</strong> undertake a critical analysis of police evidence and witness statements because as they say client’s reputation is their priority.</p>

					<p>With the wide variety of different types of water softeners that exist in today’s market, it has become much easier to find a softener that perfectly suits one’s softening needs and still fit into their budget. Water softeners basically do the job of changing hard water, which is harmful, to soft water, which is healthy and safe. They are able to do this using different mechanisms depending on the type and volume of water to be softened. This difference in how they work, is what gives rise to different types of water softener systems such as the manual, timer, electric and the metered types of softener systems. Water softeners also vary in terms of brand, price, size and use.</p>
<p>One of the most popular brands of water softeners today is General Electrics&#8217;, GE water softening systems. The brand offers softeners ranging from small-size single-person systems, to large multiple-person softener systems. All these systems come with advanced software control technology called Smart Soft, plus power saving transformers and smart softening gauges.<br />
<img class="size-full wp-image-25 aligncenter" src="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/images-6.jpg" alt="images (6)" width="223" height="226" />Other water softener brands that are popular around the world include; Auto trol water softening systems which offer complete softener units for both residential and commercial uses. Their softeners come with wall-mount transformers, smart chips and microprocessors, advanced softening controls and internal bypass for salt regeneration. Kinetico water softening system is yet another popular brand that offers non-electric softener units. Their units are relatively expensive to buy, but have a longer lifespan and lesser maintenance requirements compared to other top brands. They usually design their softeners with manual controls.</p>
<p>The Fleck water softening system is a softener brand that has been around for a long time. It specializes mainly in residential water softener units. Their units come with a meter to prevent wastage of water, which is an uncommon feature among most top brands. Fleck softeners are also available in a very wide range of tank sizes and are known to be very economically priced. Kenmore brand of water softeners are also gaining popularity mainly because of their feature-rich softener systems. They have several models on the market right now ranging from basic single-tap units to large heavy-duty units.</p>
<p>Another very unique and popular set of water softener brands are the Culligan softening systems and the Clack softener systems. The former is deemed unique because, besides offering very durable water softener units for purchase, they also offer them on a rental basis in most of their operating countries. In addition to this, they have a softening salt delivery service that they offer to customers that use their softener models. Clack water softeners offer mainly electric softener systems that come with a very user-friendly design even for their heavy-duty units which makes using them a lot easier. They are preferred mainly for their wide range of tank sizes and their high flow rate.<br />

					<p>Imagine that you are a librarian. People come to you with all their queries, and you need to suggest them books that most closely relate to what they need. For that, you need to know what these books are about, their content, and maybe even how they relate to each other. Search engines are like much like a librarian, one that has to keep the information of all the sites of the world based on their algorithm. And this algorithm also decides the ranking of these websites when a related keyword is searched for. 94% of the people search the internet before buying something, and of those, 90% click on the first link that comes up the search result. Improving the rank of a particular website by making sure that the website has all the required necessities for the search engine algorithm is what is known as Search Engine Optimization or <strong>SEO</strong>. What constitutes the algorithm is a well-guarded secret, but as it turns out, most of the ingredients necessary for enhanced page ranking are known to us, which are, namely:</p>
<ul>
<li>Words</li>
<li>Titles</li>
<li>Links</li>
<li>Words in Links</li>
<li>Reputation</li>
</ul>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-21 aligncenter" src="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/AAEAAQAAAAAAAAbSAAAAJDAyZDNmNWE3LTEyMjYtNDFjMS1hZTBjLTJmODQ5NzExNDU3MA.jpg" alt="AAEAAQAAAAAAAAbSAAAAJDAyZDNmNWE3LTEyMjYtNDFjMS1hZTBjLTJmODQ5NzExNDU3MA" width="200" height="150" /></p>
<p>The most important factor is the usage of words in the website. When a keyword is searched, the search engine narrows down results based on the words that are present in the website itself. Let’s suppose that someone searched for “Old cars”, the search results would be narrowed down to websites that have the phrase “old cars” in their website.</p>
<p>The next in the list comes the title, which may not always be the one which is visible to the end user, as it may have a different header in the coding of the page. The web-crawlers or spiders of the search engine, which continually crawl all over the internet to build the index for these search engines, pay close attention to the heading as they often summarise the page, akin to a book’s title.</p>
<p>Links also help build the index and enhance the page rank as a link is tantamount to a referral, more the links, better is the website in term of the algorithm. However, some website developers link their own webpage from other websites owned by their own firm. To overcome this problem, links from reputed sites are given higher priority than other websites. Words in the links also matter as much as the links themselves. Let’s say that it is written in some website that Digital Edge has the best articles, and articles link to Digital Edge, the search engine would automatically associate Digital Edge with articles, and the next time someone searches for articles, the search engine would place Digital Edge higher in the ranks.</p>
<p><img class="size-full wp-image-22 aligncenter" src="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1435048339_seogoogle.jpg" alt="1435048339_seogoogle" width="250" height="250" srcset="http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1435048339_seogoogle-150x150.jpg 150w, http://www.ermeni.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/1435048339_seogoogle.jpg 250w" sizes="(max-width: 250px) 100vw, 250px" /></p>
<p>And last, but definitely not the least, comes reputation. Now reputation does not mean word of mouth. For a search engine, even reputation is mathematical formula, which is based on the amount of traffic the website encounters, the rate of growth of quality links, the number of good, non-plagiarized articles written and so on and so forth. And based on that the ranking of any website changes a lot from time to time.</p>
<p>It might be quite obvious by now that it is not an easy task, and needs a great deal of understanding how things work on the internet, the policies that are followed by the different search engine, the changes and inclusions in the page ranking algorithm of the different search engines. Thus, there are numerous firms that help you in climbing up the search result ranks, such as <strong><a href="http://torontodesigned.com/seo.html">seo toronto</a> </strong>group, toronto<strong> </strong>designed and so on. All in all, for any business, it is essential to have a larger reach out to the people, and what other way to make sure of that than to become the best choice in a Google search?</p>
