<p>Aragorn II, the heir of Arathorn II and Gilraen, also identified as Elessar, held the 16th Chieftain of the Dúnedain in the North; he was later crowned King Elessar Telcontar (March 1, 2931 &#8211; FO 120 or SR 1541), the 26th King of Arnor. Also, the 35th King of Gondor and first High King of Gondor and Arnor, because the short rule of Isildur. He was a great warrior, and as the heir of Isildur bore the shards of Narsil, reforged and renamed Andúril, in the War of the Ring. Aragorn was a descendant of Elros Tar-Minyatur. His ancestor Arvedui did wed to Fíriel, who was descended from Anárion, who carried their son Aranarth, also making Aragorn the last descendant of Anárion as well.<br />
When Aragorn was only two years old, his father Arathorn was killed while pursuing orcs. Aragorn was later fostered in Rivendell through Elrond. At the behest of his mother, his ancestors was kept confidential, as she worried he would be slain like his father and grandfather if his true identity as the descendant of Elendil and Heir of Isildur became known. Aragorn was renamed Estel and was not informed about his heritage till 2951. Elrond explained to &#8220;Estel&#8221; his true name and ancestry when he was twenty, and gave to him the Ring of Barahir and the Shards of Narsil. Elrond withheld the Sceptre of Annúminas from Aragorn until he &#8220;came off the right&#8221; to possess the item. It was also at this time that Aragorn met and fell in love with Arwen, Elrond&#8217;s daughter, newly returned from her mother&#8217;s homeland of Lórien where she had visited her grandmother Galadriel.

<p>One of the most pivotal antagonist in the tale of middle earth would have to be the witch king of Angmar a men who once lead the armies of men but fell to the taint of one of the nine rings of power given to corrupt by Sauron. Following the defeat of the darklord in the second age the Witch King fled back to his territory of Angmar were he ruled for thousands of years until being called to drive the forces of Mordor against the war of the one ring.The Lord of the Nazgûl reentered in TA 1300 in the north adjacent the lost realm of Arnor. There he organized the kingdom of Angmar. It was after the creation of Angmar and various conflicts with the Dúnedain of the Northland that the Lord of the Nazgûl took the title of Witch-king, Lord of Angmar.He then started his open war operations with the three divided kingdoms of Arnor (Arthedain, Rhudaur, and Cardolan). In TA 1356, the Witch-king overran the kingdom of Rhudaur and substituted the Dúnedain king of the land with a hill chief associated to Angmar. King Argeleb of Arthedain was slain trying to protect Rhudaur against Angmar. In TA 1409 the companies of the Witch-King struck the fortress of Amon Sûl and roasted the tower, during which battle King Arveleg of Arthedain was killed.  Its not like now when you have ways of commnicating through devices and the means of fixing them with these <a href="http://www.cellphonerepairsolutions.com/">phone repairs shop</a>. <a href="http://plan9.ca/9-2/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>Gandalf walked for many years amongst the Free Folk of Middle-earth but filled utmost of that time amongst the Elves, where he studied much and taught much. He also proceeded to gather such knowledge about Sauron and his ilk as he could, and to that point, he started to suspect that the Necromancer of Dol Guldur remained, in fact, Sauron getting shaped once again. He entered Dol Guldur, but Sauron, still significantly weakened, fled from him and for a short time, the evil of Mirkwood was significantly decreased. However, Sauron immediately returned to Dol Guldur, and by 2850 of the Third Age, had reassembled his powers there. In that year, Gandalf repeatedly entered the fortress and found Thráin II, father of Thorin Oakenshield, who was weakening after having been horribly tortured. Before his death, the old Dwarf king consigned Gandalf with a map to Erebor.<br />
In the year 2941, Gandalf grew troubled by his understanding of Sauron&#8217;s resurgent strength. He grasped that Sauron was then plotting war from Dol Guldur, and that as shortly as he felt powerful enough, he would strike Rivendell. Regrettably, the only power left besides Rivendell to counter an effort from Mirkwood to recover the areas of Angmar was the Dwarves of the Iron Hills. Even severely, Gandalf remembered that Smaug to Golden lived still in Erebor and that Sauron could and would use the dragon to destructive effect once he became strong enough to control Smaug. However, Saruman appeared reluctant to engage Sauron&#8217;s forces, though none of the White Council realized that he was then a traitor. One night, while considering the problem of the Free People&#8217;s vulnerability in the North, Gandalf had a chance meeting in Bree with the Dwarf Thorin II Oakenshield, who was also searching, without way or much hope, for a way to restore the Kingdom Under the Mountain.  <a href="http://plan9.ca/quest-to-erebor/" class="more-link">Continue reading <span class="meta-nav">&rarr;</span></a></p>

<p>Considered the wisest of the Maiar, Gandalf was formerly a Maia of Manwë known as the Wind-King, Varda the Star-Queen, Irmo the Dream-Master also Nienna the Weeper called Olórin. When the Valar chose to send the order of the Istari (also acknowledged as Wizards) to Middle-earth, to advise and assist all those in Middle-earth who fought the Dark Lord Sauron, Manwë and Varda determined to include Olórin amongst the five who were sent. At first, Olórin was nervous and expressed himself as too inadequate and too frightened of Sauron. Manwë knew and told him that that was one central reason why he should go, to subdue that fear. Thus, he ordered that Olórin should go as the third, but Varda convinced him not to admit Olórin as the third, but as the second. Olórin agreed, and planned for his departure from the Undying Lands with the other four wizards.When he arrived in Middle Earth, he received Narya, the ring of fire, from Círdan the Shipwright. Olórin, renamed Gandalf ( the name &#8220;translated&#8221; from Western to Norse by Tolkien), spent several centuries walking amongst the elves as a stranger, hearing from them and showing them. He later declared himself as one of the Istari, and ultimately grew known as the wisest of and most powerful of that company. He entered the White Council, which was established to examine a dark power in Dol Guldur, of that Galadriel, needed him to become the leader, yet Saruman began to lead the Council rather of him. Although Saruman was at primary more powerful, was more informed about many elements regarding Sauron and the Rings of Power, and was the leader of the White Council earlier before the War of the Ring, he later became resentful and afraid of Gandalf, which was the basis for his betrayal.</p>
