                    <h2>About Booked Up</h2>

                    <p>Booked Up was a national programme that ran for five years from 2007-11.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Booked Up gave every 11-year-old in England the chance to choose a free book during their first term at secondary school. The aim of the programme was to support and encourage reading for pleasure and independent choice. Year 7 students chose their free book from a list of carefully selected titles.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>During its five years, Booked Up gave a free book to over 3.25 million children in England.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
                    <p>Booked Up was run by Booktrust, funded by the Department for Education, and generously supported by children's book publishers.</p>
                    <p>&nbsp;</p>
