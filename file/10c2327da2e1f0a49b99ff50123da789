    <p><b>We base our casino recommendations on various 
      factors: </b></p>
    <p>1. The casino software. Most online casinos 
      use 3rd party gambling software from a few established companies, and 
      customize it to their requirements. All wagers are processed through 
      the 3rd party servers, giving gamblers security from unscrupulous independent 
      operators. We only review fully licensed casinos using trusted 3rd party 
      gaming servers, so you are guaranteed a secure place to gamble. <br />
    </p>
    <p>2. Bulletin board searches and player complaints / praise- Internet Forums are a great source of info for any payout issues or customer support problems.</p>
    <p>4 'Atmosphere and Style' The casino has got 
      to be fun to play in, no matter how many games or features it has. Small 
      features such as adjustable sound effects and background music, lend 
      a degree of professionalism to the casino. A clean, easy to follow layout is also an advantage, especially when there is a large selection of games.    </p>
    <p>3. Bonus offers. There are often some great 
      bonus features for new players at a casino, usually free chips, and 
      often regular bonus prizes, holidays, cars etc.<br />
      A good casino will keep itself fresh with regular new offers, that must also be fair and easy to understand.</p>
    <p>5. Customer Support. Free 24/7 international 
      helplines are a must. We test our recommended casinos with random questions 
      for help, and judge the speed and accuracy of the response.</p>
    <p>Finally pay-out percentages are taken into 
      consideration. Most casinos have published accountants reports online, 
      which we check for consistent payout rates. Almost all established internet 
      casinos operate to 'Las Vegas Standards so you have at least the same 
      odds as playing in a real casino. Usually 95-98 % plus for slots, and higher 
      rates for the card games, especially blackjack.</p>
    <p>Good luck!<br />

      Cherry Blossoms Slot Review </strong><br />
      The Japanese culture is a mesmerizing one and Cherry Blossoms slot game has all of the beautiful characteristics of the culture. This is fairly a new game that Vegas Technology put in their games library. Cherry Blossoms comes with 25 pay lines that you can adjust if you want and is played on 5 reels. There's an array of attention-grabbing features that players will notice as they spin the reels. These include multipliers to increase the wins, scatter payouts, wild symbols and free games. <br />
      Cherry Blossoms belongs to the broad assortment of bonus video slots that can be found within the casino software. This game can be played via the download or instant play mode. <br />
      Cherry Blossoms come with multiple coin values that can be wagered per line. You can alter the pay lines before each spin to accommodate to your budget. Enabling all lines is really the best way to go though so you don't land a win that isn't on the pay line that you are not wagering on. The coin values come in many diverse forms that are between 0.01-10.00 with several in between. <br />
      <br />
The Geisha Girl lets her appearance be known when she appears on the reels as she is the wild symbol and comes with a multiplier to increase the payouts when she concludes the winning combinations. Her powers will double all winnings if and when she is a part of the winning payout.<br />
<br />
      The Cherry Blossoms will give you free spins if three or more appear anywhere on the reels. The more Cherry Blossoms that show up on the screen the more free games that you will be awarded. All pays that come from the free games will be paid out with the regular wins; no multipliers are attached to the free games. The free spins can be re triggered if the Cherry Blossoms appear during the free games that are being played. You can also receive up to 200x your total bet amount if 5 appear to initiate the feature. If you can get the free spins to re trigger more than once, you can bank some good size wins. <br />
      Other thematic symbols that will run across the screen include the Japanese Fan, Japanese Lantern, the Japanese House. All provide payouts; these payouts can be found on the pay table.<br />
      <br />
      <em>Cherry Blossoms Jackpot Amounts:</em><br />
      5 Geisha Girls are the top prize in this game and will award 12,500 coins when 5 make it to the reels providing they are on one active line, 2,500 coins is next in line for 5 Japanese House. The Japanese Lantern comes in third place with granting 500 coins. <br />
      <br />
      <br />
      <b>Rewards and chip bonuses</b>:<br />
      New 'real money' players are eligible to receive a $100 'welcome bonus' 
      with their first $100 deposit. Like all internet casinos, any cash bonus 
      given away free for promotion purposes must be gambled at least once before 
      you can withdraw it. This is strictly for new players only.<br />
      More rewards are possible once you become a real player. Regular car and 
    vacation prizes are featured.</p>
    <p><b>High Gambling Security</b><br />
      For security purposes, the casino is audited by PWC, one of the biggest 
      auditing firms. This is pretty much a standard these days for any respectable 
      internet casino and 97% average payout rates were certified returned to 
      players last year.<br />
      Gaming Software is provided by <i>Vegas Technology</i> (the 3rd party software 
      containing the random number generator and controlling payout percentages.)<br />
      Vegas Tech software is generally regarded asone of the the most, secure 
      and trusted gaming softwares available, and all casinos using this software 
      are highly regulated and must reach very high standards.A 'Fair Gaming Policy' 
      is used which means that the casino software 
      uses  random number generators to determine the game results. This ensures a completely fair game for both the casino and the player.<br />
      It also stops some players from gaining an unfair advantage by using card 
      counting techniques which would be simple at an internet casino, using specialist software.<br />
      Here, one pack 
      is reshuffled after each game.<br />
      The random number generator is tested on an regular basis to ensure compliance 
      with Las Vegas standards.<br />
      <br />
      <b>Payins and Withdrawals</b>:<br />
      There is no charge to make pay-ins or withdrawals, and your winnings are 
      delivered within 10 days by international shipping companies, if you choose a paper check, or faster by a variety of online banking methods.<br />
      There are a large number of alternative pay-in methods available if your bank is playing 
      'nanny' and refusing credit card transactions for online casinos.</p>
    <p><b>Summary</b>.<br />
      This casino is lots of fun.  Liberty Slots is one of the most popular casinos 
      online with thousands of regular players and is very highly regarded in 
      the online gaming community, all for very good reason.<br />

      <strong>Break Da Bank Again Slot Review </strong><br />
      <br />
      <img src="break_free.jpg" width="240" height="180" alt="break the bank" /><br />
      <br />
      <em><strong>Break Da Bank Again</strong></em> is a sequel to the 3 reel classic game that players have grown to love at Microgaming casinos. This game comes with 5 reels and 9 pay lines with a 5x multiplier and a free games feature that comes with a 25x multiplier. <br />
      Microgaming are the gaming developers of this game and had the original players in mind when designing the game for the simplicity and the distinctiveness. <br />
      Players can  enjoy lots of play time with there only being 9 pay lines and the lowest coin size coming in at 0.01. There is a 10 coin max meaning the maximum wager amount per spin only equals out to be 0.90. <br />
      <br />
      The multiplier and wild symbol is the Break Da Bank logo. It replaces other symbols and adds a 5x multiplier for all wins that derive from the wild symbol creating the payout. Stacks of Money, Gold, Checks and some Precious Gems are all a part of the symbols that make up the winning combinations. <br />
      There are some nice animations here - game players will notice that the Safes open up with the bank robber walking out of the vault. There could be a few more animations to go along with the theme, but all in all the graphics and design of the game comes in with a decent quality.      <br />
      Free spins are the bonus feature offered and they can be triggered when at least three of the Safes appear on the reels. The amount of free games is dependent on how many Safes trigger the bonus round.  If 5 Safes appear the maximum 25 free games will be awarded, but that isn't the actual amount you will actually play - 
      The unique feature with this game is that during the free games whenever a Safe appears an additional free spin will be added to the total amount of  games that are left to play out. <br />
      The bonus feature cannot be re triggered due to the additional free games that can be won during  play. If the Break Da Bank logo appears and is part of any winning combination during the free games there will be a 25x payout. <br />
      The Safes are considered the scatter symbol and will payout scatter wins for when just two make it to the reels. <br />
      Another feature offered is the gamble option. This feature is for all the players that are feeling extra lucky. After a winning spin has been landed players can click on the gamble button to be taken to a second screen where they will notice a playing card that is face down. They will need to decide if they want to try and guess which colour the card will be or the suit. If they guess the correct colour the payout will be double. If they want to go for the gold they can try and guess the correct suit. If they do and succeed they will win 4x the amount that was staked to get them into the gamble feature. If they guess incorrectly all wins are lost and they are taken back to the regular game play.<br />
      <br />
      <strong>Top Jackpot Amounts</strong><br />
      Break Da Bank Again doesn't come with a progressive jackpot prize, however there with a 5x multiplier during the regular games and a 25x during the free spins, players can bank some pretty good size prize amounts. 1,500 coins is won when 5 of the Precious Gems appear, this amount can be more is there is a wild symbol within the winning payout. The second highest fixed jackpot amount is worth 1,000 coins for 5 Gold Bars.<br />
      <strong><br />
      MEGASPIN VERSION
      </strong>. Break Da Bank again is also available as a megapin version where you can play 4 games at once.<br />
      The bet limits are vastly increased here, and big spenders are able to play up to &pound;4 per game for a total of &pound;16 per spin. Obviously some huge wins are possible here, but so is the chance to get through your bankroll pretty fast if your lucks not in.<br />
      This is a pretty HIGH VARIANCE game, where you either win a lot or lose a lot.
      <br />
      Getting the free spin bonus is essential to a big win, with the 5x multiplier symbols.<br />
      Most players will be content to play each game on the regular bet size.<br />
